Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of column
subset selection. We present a novel analysis of
the spectral norm reconstruction for a simple randomized algorithm and establish a new bound
that depends explicitly on the sampling probabilities. The sampling dependent error bound (i) allows us to better understand the tradeoff in the
reconstruction error due to sampling probabilities, (ii) exhibits more insights than existing error bounds that exploit specific probability distributions, and (iii) implies better sampling distributions. In particular, we show that a sampling distribution with probabilities proportional
to the square root of the statistical leverage scores
is better than uniform sampling, and is better
than leverage-based sampling when the statistical leverage scores are very nonuniform. And by
solving a constrained optimization problem related to the error bound with an efficient bisection search we are able to achieve better performance than using either the leverage-based distribution or that proportional to the square root
of the statistical leverage scores. Numerical simulations demonstrate the benefits of the new sampling distributions for low-rank matrix approximation and least square approximation compared
to state-of-the art algorithms.

1. Introduction
Give a data matrix A ‚àà Rm√ón , column subset selection
(CSS) is an important technique for constructing a compressed representation and a low rank approximation of A
by selecting a small number of columns. Compared with
conventional singular value decomposition (SVD), CSS
could yield more interpretable output while maintaining
performance close to SVD (Mahoney, 2011). Recently,
CSS has been applied successfully to problems of interest
to geneticists such as genotype reconstruction, identifying
substructure in heterogeneous populations, etc. (Mahoney,
2011).
Let C ‚àà Rm√ó` be the matrix formed by ` selected columns
of A. The key question to CSS is how to select the columns
to minimize the reconstruction error:
kA ‚àí PC AkŒæ ,
where PC = CC ‚Ä† denotes the projection onto the column
space of C with C ‚Ä† being the pseudo-inverse of C and
Œæ = 2 or F corresponds to the spectral norm or the Frobenius norm (Meyer, 2000). In this paper, we are particularly
interested in the spectral norm reconstruction with respect
to a target rank k.
Our analysis is developed for a randomized algorithm that
selects ` > k columns from A according to sampling probabilities s = (s1 , . . . , sn ). Building on advanced matrix
concentration inequalities (e.g., matrix Chernoff bound and
Bernstein inequality), we develop a novel analysis of the
spectral norm reconstruction and establish a sampling dependent relative spectral error bound with a high probabil-

ity as following:
kA ‚àí PC Ak2 ‚â§ (1 + (s))kA ‚àí Ak k2 ,
where Ak is the best rank-k approximation of A based
on SVD and (s) is a quantity dependent on the sampling
probabilities s besides the scalars n, k, `. As revealed in
our main theorem (Theorem 1), the quantity (s) also depends on the statistical leverage scores (SLS) inherent to
the data (c.f. Section 3), based on which are several important randomized algorithms for CSS.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such kind of
error bound for CSS. Compared with existing error bounds,
the sampling dependent error bound brings us several benefits: (i) it allows us to better understand the tradeoff in the
spectral error of reconstruction due to sampling probabilities, complementary to a recent result on the tradeoff from
a statistical perspective (Ma et al., 2014) for least square
regression; (ii) it implies that a distribution with sampling
probabilities proportional to the square root of the SLS is
better than the uniform sampling, and is potentially better than that proportional to the SLS when they are skewed;
(iii) it motivates an optimization approach by solving a constrained optimization problem related to the error bound
to attain better performance. In addition to the theoretical
analysis, we also develop an efficient bisection search algorithm to solve the constrained optimization problem for
finding better sampling probabilities.

2008; Boutsidis et al., 2009).
Depending on whether ` > k is allowed, the error bounds
for CSS are different. If exactly k columns are selected to
form C, the best bound was achieved by the rank revealing QR factorization (Gu & Eisenstat, 1996) with the error
bound given by:
p
kA ‚àí PC Ak2 ‚â§ 1 + k(n ‚àí k)kA ‚àí Ak k2 . (1)
with a running time O(mnk log n). The same error bound
was also achieved by using volume sampling (Deshpande
& Rademacher, 2010). The running time of volume sampling based algorithms can be made close to linear to the
size of the target matrix.
If more than k columns are allowed to be selected, i.e.,
` > k, better error bounds can be achieved. In the most
recent work by Boutsidis et al. (2011), nearly optimal error
bounds were shown by selecting ` > k columns with a deterministic selection criterion based on the dual set spectral
sparsification. In particular, a deterministic polynomialtime algorithm 1 was proposed that achieves the following
error bound:

2. Related Work
In this section, we review some previous work on CSS,
low-rank matrix approximation, and other closely related
work on randomized algorithms for matrices. We focus our
discussion on the spectral norm reconstruction.
Depending on whether the columns are selected deterministically or randomly, the algorithms for CSS can be categorized into deterministic algorithms and randomized algorithms. Deterministic algorithms select ` ‚â• k columns
with some deterministic selection criteria. Representative
algorithms in this category are rank revealing QR factorization and its variants from the filed of numerical linear
algebra (Gu & Eisenstat, 1996; Pan, 2000; Pan & Tang,
1999). A recent work (Boutsidis et al., 2011) based on the
dual set spectral sparsification also falls into this category
which will be discussed shortly. Randomized algorithms
usually define sampling probabilities s ‚àà Rn and then select ` ‚â• k columns based on these sampling probabilities.
Representative sampling probabilities include ones that depend the squared Euclidean norm of columns (better for
Frobenius norm reconstruction) (Frieze et al., 2004), the
squared volume of simplices defined by the selected subsets of columns (known as volume sampling) (Deshpande
& Rademacher, 2010), and the SLS (known as leveragebased sampling or subspace sampling) (Drineas et al.,

n+Œ±
bound is close to the lower bound ‚Ñ¶
`+Œ±2 , Œ± > 0
established in their work. It is worth mentioning that the
selection scores in (Boutsidis et al., 2011) computed based
on the dual set spectral sparsification is difficult to understand than the SLS.

Although our sampling dependent error bound is not directly comparable to these results, our analysis exhibits
that the derived error bound could be better than that in (2)
when the SLS are nonuniform. Most importantly, the sampling probabilities in our algorithm are only related to the
SLS and that can be computed more efficiently (e.g., exactly in O(TVk ) or approximately in O(mn log n) (Drineas
et al., 2012)). In simulations, we observe that the new sampling distributions could yield even better spectral norm
reconstruction than the deterministic selection criterion
in (Boutsidis et al., 2011), especially when the SLS are
nonuniform.
For low rank matrix approximation, several other randomized algorithms have been recently developed. For example, Halko et al. (2011) used a random Gaussian matrix
‚Ñ¶ ‚àà Rn√ó` or a subsampled random Fourier transform to
construct a matrix ‚Ñ¶ and then project A into the column

space of Y = A‚Ñ¶, and they established numerous spectral
error
p bounds. Among them is a comparable error bound
O( n/`)kA ‚àí Ak k2 to (2) using the subsampled random
Fourier transform. Other randomized algorithm for low
rank approximation include CUR decomposition (Drineas
et al., 2008; Wang & Zhang, 2012; 2013) and the NystroÃàm
based approximation for PSD matrices (Drineas & Mahoney, 2005; Gittens & Mahoney, 2013).
Besides low rank matrix approximation and column selection, CSS has also been successfully applied to least
square approximation, leading to faster and interpretable
algorithms for over-constrained least square regression. In
particular, if let ‚Ñ¶ ‚àà R`√óm denote a scaled sampling matrix corresponding to selecting ` < m rows from A, the
least square problem minx‚ààRn kAx ‚àí bk22 can be approximately solved by minx‚ààRn k‚Ñ¶Ax ‚àí ‚Ñ¶bk22 (Drineas et al.,
2008; 2006b; 2011). Ma et al. (2014) studied CSS for least
square approximation from a statistical perspective. They
exhibited the expectation and variance of the solution to
the approximated least square with uniform sampling and
leverage-based sampling. They found that leveraging based
estimator could suffer from a large variance when the SLS
are very nonuniform while uniform sampling is less vulnerable to very small SLS. This tradeoff is complementary
to our observation. However, our observation follows directly from the spectral norm error bound. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution with probabilities proportional to the square root of the SLS is always
better than uniform sampling, suggesting that intermediate
sampling probabilities between SLS and their square roots
by solving a constrained optimization problem could yield
better performance than the mixing strategy that linearly
combines the SLS and uniform probabilities as suggested
in (Ma et al., 2014).
There are much more work on studying the Frobenius norm
reconstruction of CSS (Drineas et al., 2006a; Guruswami
& Sinop, 2012; Boutsidis et al., 2011; Drineas et al., 2008;
Boutsidis et al., 2009). For more references, we refer the
reader to the survey (Mahoney, 2011). It remains an interesting question to establish sampling dependent error
bounds for other randomized matrix algorithms.

3. Preliminaries
Let A ‚àà Rm√ón be a matrix of size m√ón and have a rank of
œÅ ‚â§ min(m, n). Let k < œÅ be a target rank to approximate
A. We write the SVD decomposition of A as

 > 
Œ£1 0
V1
A=U
0 Œ£2
V2>
where Œ£1 ‚àà Rk√ók , Œ£2 ‚àà R(œÅ‚àík)√ó(œÅ‚àík) , V1 ‚àà Rn√ók and
V2 ‚àà Rn√ó(œÅ‚àík) . We use œÉ1 , œÉ2 , . . . to denote the singular values of A in the descending order, and Œªmax (X)
and Œªmin (X) to denote the maximum and minimum eigen-

values of a PSD matrix X. For any orthogonal matrix
U ‚àà Rn√ó` , let U ‚ä• ‚àà Rn√ó(n‚àí`) denote an orthogonal matrix whose columns are an orthonormal basis spanning the
subspace of Rn that is orthogonal to the column space of
U.
Let
Pn s = (s1 ,2. . . , sn ) be a set of scores such that
i=1 si = k , one for each column of A. We will
drawn ` independent samples with replacement from the
set [n] = {1, . . . , n} using a multinomial distribution
where
Pnthe probability of choosing the ith column is pi =
si / j=1 sj . Let i1 , . . . , i` be the indices of ` > k selected
columns 3 , and S ‚àà Rn√ó` be the corresponding sampling
matrix, i.e,

1,
if i = ij
Si,j =
0, otherwise,
and D ‚àà R`√ó` be a diagonal rescaling matrix with Djj =
1
‚àö . Given S, we construct the C matrix as
sij
C = AS = (Ai1 , . . . , Ai` ).
(3)
Our interest is to bound the spectral norm error between A
and PC A for a given sampling matrix S, i.e., kA ‚àí PC Ak2 ,
where PC A projects A onto the column space of C. For
the benefit of presentation, we define ‚Ñ¶ = SD ‚àà Rn√ó` to
denote the sampling-and-rescaling matrix, and
Y = A‚Ñ¶, ‚Ñ¶1 = V1> ‚Ñ¶, ‚Ñ¶2 = V2> ‚Ñ¶,
(4)
where ‚Ñ¶1 ‚àà Rk√ó` and ‚Ñ¶2 ‚àà R(œÅ‚àík)√ó` . Since the column
space of Y is the same to that of C, therefore
kA ‚àí PC Ak2 = kA ‚àí PY Ak2
and we will bound kA ‚àí PY Ak2 in our analysis. Let
V1> = (v1 , . . . , vn ) ‚àà Rk√ón and V2> = (u1 , . . . , un ) ‚àà
R(œÅ‚àík)√ón . It is easy to verify that
‚Ñ¶1 = (vi1 , . . . , vi` )D, ‚Ñ¶2 = (ui1 , . . . , ui` )D
Finally, we let s‚àó = (s‚àó1 , . . . , s‚àón ) denote the SLS of A
relative to the best rank-k approximation to A (Mahoney,
2011),
s‚àói = kvi k22 . It is not difficult to show that
Pn i.e.,
‚àó
i=1 si = k.

4. Main Result
Before presenting our main result, we first characterize
scores in s by two quantities as follows:
p ‚àó
si
s‚àói
, q(s) = max
(5)
c(s) = max
1‚â§i‚â§n si
1‚â§i‚â§n si
Both quantities compare s to the SLS s‚àó . With c(s) and
q(s), we are ready to present our main theorem regarding
the spectral error bound.
Theorem 1. Let A ‚àà Rm√ón have rank œÅ and C ‚àà Rm√ó`
2
For the sake of discussion, we are not restricting the sum of
these scores to be one but to be k, which does not affect our conclusions.

Note that some of the selected columns could be duplicate.

contain the selected columns according to sampling scores
in s. With a probability 1 ‚àí Œ¥ ‚àí 2k exp(‚àí`/[8kc(s)]), we
have
kA ‚àí PC Ak2 ‚â§ œÉk+1 (1 + (s))
where (s) is

`
`
where œÉk+1 = kA ‚àí Ak k2 is the (k + 1)th singular value
of A.
Remark: The proof is deferred to Section 6. Clearly, the
spectral error bound and the successful probability in Theorem 1 depend on the quantities c(s) and q(s). In the subsection below, we study the two quantities to facilitate the
understanding of the result in Theorem 1.
4.1. More about the two quantities and their tradeoffs
The result in Theorem 1 implies that the smaller the quantities c(s) and q(s), the better the error bound. Therefore,
we first study when c(s) and q(s) achieve their minimum
values. The key results are presented in the following two
lemmas with their proofs deferred to the supplement.
Lemma 1. The set of scores‚àö
in s that minimize q(s) is given
p ‚àó
k s‚àó
by si ‚àù si , i.e., si = Pn ‚àöi ‚àó .
i=1

Remark: The sampling distribution with probabilities that
are proportional to the square root of s‚àói , i ‚àà [n] falls in between the uniform sampling and the leverage-based sampling.
Pm
Lemma 2. c(s) ‚â• 1, ‚àÄs such that i=1 si = k. The set of
scores in s that minimize c(s) is given by si = s‚àói , and the
minimum value of c(s) is 1.
Next, we discuss three special samplings with s (i)pproportional to the square root of the SLS, i.e., si ‚àù s‚àói (referred to as square-root leverage-based sampling or sqLsampling for short), (ii) equal to the SLS, i.e., si = s‚àói
(referred to as leverage-based sampling or L-sampling for
short), and (iii) equal to uniform scalars si = k/n (referred
to as uniform sampling or U-sampling for short).
p ‚àó
sqL-sampling. Firstly, if si ‚àù
si , q(s) achieves its
minimum value and we have the two quantities written as
n
1 Xp ‚àó
si
qsqL =
k i=1
(6)
P p
p
s‚àói i s‚àói

In this case,

p nwhen s sqL
qsqL =
and
c
= 1. The bound becomes
k
p
p
e (œÅ + 1 ‚àí k)k/` + nk/`2 )œÉk+1 that suppresses logO(
arithmic terms. To analyze qsqL and csqL for skewed SLS,

we consider a power-law distributed SLS, i.e., there exists a small constant a and power index p > 2, such that
s‚àó[i] , i = 1, . . . , n ranked in descending order satisfy
s‚àó[i] ‚â§ a2 i‚àíp , i = 1, . . . , n
Then it is not difficult to show that

which is independent
of n. Then the
q
 error bound in TheœÅ+1‚àík

orem 1 becomes O
+ ` œÉk+1 , which is better
`
than that in (2). This result is summarized in Corollary 3 at
the end of this subsection.
L-sampling. Secondly, if si = s‚àói , then c(s) achieves its
minimum value and we have the two quantities written as
1
(8)
qL = max p ‚àó , cL = 1
i
si
p
In this case, when s‚àó is flat, we have qL = nk and cL = 1
p
p
e (œÅ + 1 ‚àí k)k/` + nk/`2 )œÉk+1
and the same bound O(
follows. However, when s‚àó is skewed, i.e., there exist very
small SLS, then qL could be very large. As a comparison,
the q(s) for sqL-sampling is always smaller than that for
L-sampling due to the following inequality
Pn ‚àó
n
n

k i=1 si
k

= max p ‚àó = qL

U-sampling. Lastly, we consider the uniform sampling
si = nk . Then the two quantities become
p
n s‚àói
ns‚àó
qU = max
, cU = max i
(9)
i
i
k p
k
Similarly, if s‚àó is flat, qU = nk and cU = 1. Moreover,
it is interesting to compare the two quantities for the sqLsampling in (6) and for the uniform sampling in (9).

From the above discussions, we can see that when s‚àó is a
flat vector, there is no difference between the three sampling scores for s. The difference comesp
from when s‚àó
tends to be skewed. In this case, si ‚àù
s‚àói works almost for sure better than uniform distribution and could
also be potentially better than si = s‚àói according to the
sampling dependent error bound in Theorem 1. A similar tradeoff between the L-sampling and U-sampling but
with a different taste was observed in (Ma et al., 2014),
where they showed that for least square approximation the
CSS leveraging-based least square estimator could have a

Sampling Dependent Spectral Error Bound for CSS

large variance when there exist very small SLS. Nonetheless, our bound here exhibits more insights, especially on
the sqL-sampling. More importantly, the sampling dependent bound renders the flexibility in choosing the sampling
scores by adjusting them according to the distribution of
the SLS. In next subsection, we present an optimization
approach to find better sampling scores. In Figure 1, we
give a quick view of different sampling strategies.
Corollary 2. Let A ‚àà Rm√ón have rank œÅ and C ‚àà Rm√ó`
contain the selected columns according to sampling scores
‚àö
in s‚àó . Assume the scores in s‚àó follow a power-law distribution as in (7) with p > 2 and ` ‚â• 8a2 (1 + 2/(p ‚àí
2)) log(k/Œ¥). With a probability at least 1 ‚àí 3Œ¥, we have
"r
#
(œÅ + 1 ‚àí k) log[ œÅŒ¥ ] log[ œÅŒ¥ ]
kA ‚àí PC Ak2 ‚â§ œÉk+1 O
+
`
`
where the big O(¬∑) suppresses the dependence on a and p.
4.2. Optimizing the error bound
As indicated by the result in Theorem 1, in order to achieve
a good performance, we need to make a balance between
c(s) an q(s), where c(s) affects not only the error bound but
also the successful probability. To address this issue, we
propose a constrained optimization approach. More specifically, to ensure that the failure probability is no more than
3Œ¥, we impose the following constraint on c(s)
 
`
k
s‚àó
`
 := Œ≥
‚â• log
, i.e., max i ‚â§
i
8kc(s)
Œ¥
si
8k log kŒ¥
(10)
Then we cast the problem into minimizing q(s) under the
constraint in (10), i.e.,
p ‚àó
si
min max

s.t. s 1 = k,
‚â§ Œ≥si , i = 1, . . . , n
(11)
It is easy to verify that the optimization problem in (11)
is convex. Next, we develop an efficient bisection search
algorithm to solve the above problem with a linear convergence rate. To this end, we introduce a slack variable t and
rewrite the optimization problem in (11) as
min
t, s.t. s> 1 = k

Figure 1. An illustration of different sampling strategies. The
mixing strategy suggested by (Ma et al., 2014) is a convex combination of U-sampling and L-sampling. Our optimization approach
gives an intermediate sampling between the sqL-sampling and the
L-sampling.

tmin = t if f (t) > k. To run the bisection algorithm, we
need to decide initial tmin and tmax . We can set tmin = 0.
To compute tmax , we make an explicit construction of s by
distributing the (1 ‚àí Œ≥ ‚àí1 ) share of the largest element of s‚àó
to the rest of the list. More specifically, let j be the index
for the largest entry in s‚àó . We set sj = ks‚àó k‚àû Œ≥ ‚àí1 and
si = s‚àói + (1 ‚àí Œ≥ ‚àí1 )ks‚àó k‚àû /(n ‚àí 1) for i 6= j. Evidently,
this solution satisfies the constraints s‚àói ‚â§ Œ≥si , i ‚àà [n] for
Œ≥ ‚â• 1. With this construction, we can show that

Œ≥
n‚àí1
,p
q(s) ‚â§ max p
ks‚àó k‚àû
ks‚àó k‚àû (1 ‚àí Œ≥ ‚àí1 )
Therefore, we set initial tmax to the value in R.H.S of the
above inequality. Given the optimal value of t = t‚àó we
s‚àó
i ‚àö
compute the optimal value of si by si =
.
‚àó
min(Œ≥,t‚àó

si )

The corresponding sampling distribution clearly lies between L-sampling and sqL-sampling. In particular, when
Œ≥ = 1 the resulting sampling distribution is L-sampling
due to Lemma 2 and when Œ≥ ‚Üí ‚àû the resulting sampling
distribution approaches sqL-sampling.
Finally, we comment on the value of `. In order to make
the constraint in (10) feasible, we need to ensure Œ≥ ‚â• 1.
Therefore, we need ` ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(k log kŒ¥ ).
4.3. Subsequent Applications
Next, we discuss two subsequent applications of CSS, one
for low rank approximation and one for least square approximation.

We now find the optimal solution by performing bisection

Evidently, t is a feasible solution if f (t) ‚â§ k and is not if

Rank-k approximation. If a rank-k approximation is desired, we need to do some postprocessing since PC A might
have rank larger than k. We can use the same algorithm as
presented in (Boutsidis et al., 2011). In particular, given
the constructed C ‚àà Rn√ó` , we first orthonormalize the

Sampling Dependent Spectral Error Bound for CSS

The procedure for applying CSS to least square approximation is (i) to sample a set of ` > n rows from A and form
a sampling-and-rescaling matrix denoted by ‚Ñ¶ ‚àà R`√óm 4 ;
(ii) to solve the following reduced least square problem:
bopt = arg minn k‚Ñ¶Ax ‚àí ‚Ñ¶bk22

(14)
x‚ààR

It is worth pointing out that in this case the SLS s‚àó =
(s‚àó1 , . . . , s‚àóm ) are computed based on the the left singular
vectors U of A by s‚àói = kUi‚àó k22 , where Ui‚àó is the i-th
row of U . One might be interested to see whether we can
apply our analysis to derive a sampling dependent error

our analysis with previous analysis is a worse case analysis,
and consequentially yields a worse bound. The reason will
become clear in our later discussions in Section 7. However, the statistical analysis in (Ma et al., 2014) does indibopt by using sqL-sampling could have smaller
cate that x
variance than that using L-sampling.

5. Numerical Experiments
Before delving into the detailed analysis, we present some
experimental results. We consider synthetic data with the
data matrix A generated from one of the three different
classes of distributions introduced below, allowing the SLS
vary from nearly uniform to very nonuniform.
‚Ä¢ Nearly uniform SLS (GA). Columns of A are
generated from a multivariate normal distribution

These distributions have been used in (Ma et al., 2014) to
generate synthetic data for empirical evaluations.
We first compare the spectral norm reconstruction error
of the three different samplings, namely L-sampling, Usampling and the sqL-sampling, and the deterministic dual
set spectral sparsification algorithm. We generate synthetic
data with n = m = 1000 and repeat the experiments 1000
times. We note that the rank of the generated data matrix
is 1000. The averaged results are shown in Figure 2. From
these results we observe that (i) when the SLS are nearly
uniform, the three sampling strategies perform similarly
as expected; (ii) when the SLS become nonuniform, sqLsampling performs always better than U-sampling and bet-

ter than the L-sampling when the target rank is small (e.g.,
k = 10) or the sample size ` is large; (iii) when the SLS are
non-uniform, the spectral norm reconstruction error of sqLsampling decreases faster than L-sampling w.r.t the sample
size `; (iv) randomized algorithms generally perform better
than the deterministic dual set sparsification algorithm.
Second, we compare the sampling scores found the constrained optimization with L-sampling and sqL-sampling.
We vary the value of Œ≥ from 1 (corresponding to Lsampling) to ‚àû (corresponding to sqL-sampling). A result
with sampling size ` = 500 is shown in Figure 3. It demonstrates that intermediate samplings found by the proposed
constrained optimization can perform better than both Lsampling and sqL-sampling.
Finally, we apply CSS to over-constrained least square regression. To this end, we generate a synthetic data matrix
A ‚àà Rm√ón with m = 50 and n = 1000 similarly to (Ma
et al., 2014). The output is generated by y = A> Œ≤ + 
where  ‚àº (0, 9In ) and Œ≤ = (110 , 0.1130 , 110 )> . We
compare the variance and bias of the obtained estimators
over 1000 runs for different sampling distributions. The
results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate the sqL-sampling

The first inequality was proved in (Halko et al., 2011) (Theorem 9.1) and the second inequality is credited to (Boutsidis et al., 2011) (Lemma 3.2) 5 . Previous work on
the spectral norm analysis also start from a similar inequality as above. They bound the second term by
using kŒ£2 ‚Ñ¶2 ‚Ñ¶‚Ä†1 k2 ‚â§ kŒ£2 ‚Ñ¶2 k2 k‚Ñ¶‚Ä†1 k2 and then bound

7. Discussions and Open Problems
From the analysis, it is clear that the matrix Bernstein inequality is the key to derive the sampling dependent bound
>
for k‚Ñ¶2 ‚Ñ¶>
1 k2 . For bounding Œªmin (‚Ñ¶1 ‚Ñ¶1 ), similar analysis
using matrix Chernoff bound has been exploited before for
randomized matrix approximation (Gittens, 2011).
Since Lemma 3 also holds for the Frobenius norm, it might
be interested to see whether we can derive a sampling dependent Frobenius norm error bound that depends on c(s)
and q(s), which, however, still remains as an open problem for us. Nonetheless, in experiments (included in the
supplement) we observe similar phenomena about the performance of L-sampling, U-sampling and sqL-sampling.
Finally, we briefly comment on the analysis for least square
approximation using CSS. Previous results (Drineas et al.,
2008; 2006b; 2011) were built on the structural conditions
that are characterized by two inequalities
‚àö
Œªmin (‚Ñ¶U U > ‚Ñ¶) ‚â• 1/ 2

>
>
kU > ‚Ñ¶> ‚Ñ¶U ‚ä• U ‚ä• bk22 ‚â§ kU ‚ä• U ‚ä• bk22
2
The first condition can be guaranteed by Theorem 4 with
a high probability. For the second condition, if we adopt a
worse case analysis
>

>

Theorem 4. With a probability 1 ‚àí k exp(‚àíŒ¥ 2 `/[2kc(s)]),
`
we have Œªmin (‚Ñ¶1 ‚Ñ¶>
1 ) ‚â• (1 ‚àí Œ¥) k .

kU > ‚Ñ¶> ‚Ñ¶U ‚ä• U ‚ä• bk22 ‚â§ kU > ‚Ñ¶> ‚Ñ¶U ‚ä• k22 kU ‚ä• bk22
and bound the first term in R.H.S of the above inequality
using Theorem 5, we would end up with a worse bound
than existing ones that bound the left term as a whole.
Therefore the naive combination can‚Äôt yield a good sampling dependent error bound for the approximation error of
least square regression.

In this paper, we have presented a sampling dependent
spectral error bound for CSS. The error bound brings a new
distribution with sampling probabilities proportional to the
square root of the statistical leverage scores and exhibits
more tradeoffs and insights than existing error bounds for
CSS. We also develop a constrained optimization algorithm
with an efficient bisection search to find better sampling
probabilities for the spectral norm reconstruction. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the new sampling distributions lead to improved performance.
