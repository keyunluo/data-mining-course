Abstract
We present a novel class of mixed membership
models for joint distributions of groups of observations that co-occur with ordinal response variables for each group for learning statistical associations between the ordinal response variables
and the observation groups. The class of proposed models addresses a requirement for predictive and diagnostic methods in a wide range
of practical contemporary applications. In this
work, by way of illustration, we apply the models
to a collection of consumer-generated reviews of
mobile software applications, where each review
contains unstructured text data accompanied with
an ordinal rating, and demonstrate that the models infer useful and meaningful recurring patterns
of consumer feedback. We also compare the developed models to relevant existing works, which
rely on improper statistical assumptions for ordinal variables, showing significant improvements
both in predictive ability and knowledge extraction.

1. Introduction
There exist large repositories of user-generated assessment,
preference or review data consisting of free-form text data
associated with ordinal variables for quality or preference.
Examples include product reviews, user feedback, recommendation systems, expert assessments, clinical records,
survey questionnaires, economic or health status reports,
to name a few. The ubiquitous need to statistically model
the underlying processes and analyse such data collections
presents significant methodological research challenges necessitating the development of proper statistical models and
inference approaches.
In this work, our interest focuses on, but is not limited

to, analysing reviews of mobile software applications provided by consumers. Such analysis is useful for both software developers and consumers, inferring and understanding themes or properties of mobile applications that consumers comment about. These themes may involve consumers’ preferences and experiences on properties they
(dis)appreciate or direct feature requests or problems directed to the software developers.
Our work belongs in the field of mixed membership modelling, which is a powerful and important statistical modelling methodology. Observations are grouped and each
group is modelled with a mixture model; mixture components are common to all groups, whereas mixture proportions are group-specific. The components are deemed to
capture recurring patterns of observations and each group
to exhibit a subset of components. The class of models has
been shown to be able to extract interpretable meaningful
themes, also referred to as topics, based on, for example,
text data (Blei et al., 2003). These models, however, are not
able to capture statistical associations between the groups
and co-occurring quantitative information, that is, response
variables, related to each group.
Previous work on joint models utilising both the textual
data and response variables (Blei & McAuliffe, 2007; Dai
& Storkey, 2015; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2009; Nguyen et al.,
2013; Ramage et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009) has demonstrated the utility of joint modelling by inferring topics that
are predictive of the response leading to increased interpretability. However, these models lack proper statistical
formulations suitable for ordinal response variables and it
is not at all straightforward to correct this shortcoming. In
this work, we remove this hindrance by presenting a novel
class of joint mixed membership models.
The proposed class of models builds on our new statistical
generative response model for ordinal variables. In more
detail, we introduce a certain stick-breaking formulation to
parameterise underlying data-generating probabilities over
the ordinal variables. The response model contains groupspecific latent scores as well as mean variables that transform the scores into ordinal variables using the developed
construction. We compare the response model with exist-

Ordinal Mixed Membership Models

ing alternatives for ordinal variables (Albert & Chib, 1993;
Chu & Ghahramani, 2005) and show that our formulation
provides favourable statistical properties.
We present two different novel model formulations that
couple the developed response model with mixed membership models. Specifically, the formulations hierarchically couple the latent scores of the response model with
the mixing components of a mixed membership model
either via the mixture proportions or observation assignments capturing associations between the components and
responses. The first construction infers a correlation structure between (as well as, within) the mixture proportions
and latent scores based on the observed data, not enforcing
a priori any correlation structure or specifying which of
the components are associated with the responses. We derive a scalable variational Bayesian inference algorithm to
approximate the model posterior distribution. The model
is motivated by unsupervised correlated topic models by
Blei & Lafferty (2006) and Paisley et al. (2012). The
second construction assumes the latent scores of the response model are given by a weighted linear combination
of the mean assignments over each group, such that the
component-specific combination weights a posteriori provide a means to inspect components that have predictive
value. We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling scheme for posterior inference. The model is related to supervised LDA (SLDA; Blei & McAuliffe, 2007);
our model can be seen as an extension of SLDA to ordinal
responses.
We demonstrate the developed models on a collection of
reviews of mobile software applications. We compare the
models to the relevant previous work and show that the
proper ordinal response model is valuable for learning statistical associations between the responses and text data
providing significant improvements in terms of both predictive ability and knowledge extraction by inferring interpretable and useful themes of consumer feedback.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
the methodological contributions of this work: Section 2.1
presents our proposed generative model for ordinal variables, whereas the next two Sections 2.2 and 2.3 present
model formulations and inference approaches for joint
mixed membership modelling of groups of observations
and group-specific ordinal response variables. Related
work is reviewed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the experiments and contains the results. Section 5 concludes the
paper.

2. Joint Mixed Membership Models
The mth group of observations w(m) is paired with an ordinal response variable y (m) . The response variables, also

referred to as ratings, take values in R ∈ Z+ > 2 ordered categories ranging between poor (1) and excellent
(R). We note that for a simple case, when R = 2,
y (m) is binary and may be modelled by a Bernoulli distribution. The w(m) contains an unordered sequence
(m)
of D(m) words wd over a V -dimensional vocabulary,
(m)
(m)
(m)
w(m) = {w1 , w2 , . . . , wD(m) }.
2.1. Ordinal Response Variables
We assume y (m) is drawn from a categorical distribution
over R categories. The probability that y (m) takes an integer value r ∈ {1, . . . , R} is denoted by p(y (m) = r). Since
the categories are ordered, we propose a stick-breaking parameterisation for the probabilities; a unit length stick is
split into R smaller sticks that sum to one. We refer to
(m)
these smaller sticks as stick weights vr for the mth group
(m)
and rth category. We parameterise the vr using a function σ(·) mapping its argument to a value between zero and
one and introducing continuous-valued latent variables or
scores t(m) for each group as well as mean parameters µr
for each category. The generative model for the y (m) is
p(y (m) = r) = vr(m)

r−1

(1 − vr0 ),

(1)

r 0 =1
(m)

vr(m) = σ(t

− µr ).

(m)

Each vr represents a binary decision boundary, specified
by the mean variables, for the t(m) . The mean variables
are ordered, that is, µ1 < µ2 < · · · < µR , representing boundaries between the ordered categories. For computational simplicity, we use σ(x) = (1 + exp(−x))−1
corresponding to a logit (or sigmoid) function, for which
1 − σ(x) = σ(−x). Alternative choices include probit, log
log or Cauchy functions, to name a few. The stick-breaking
formulation guarantees that the probabilities p(y (m) = r),
for r = 1, . . . , R, are positive and sum to one for any value
of the t(m) . More importantly, the formulation leads to a
simple posterior inference algorithm; the ordering of the
mean variables is implicitly inferred based on the observed
data without enforcing explicit constraints. For identifia(m)
bility, we set, without loss generality, vR = 1. Figure 1
demonstrates the construction of probabilities based on the
t(m) for simulated mean variables µ.
Based on a collection of observed responses y (m) , where

to co-occur, assuming that β̃k and β̃k0 are sufficiently large.
We use (normalised) gamma-distributed variables to construct the topic proportions thus parameterising a mapping
from the continuous latent variables to the discrete topic
proportions. For simplified posterior inference we define

referred to as mean variables µ.

In the following sections, we present two approaches for
parameterising the latent scores constructing statistical associations between the responses and groups. Main statistical interest focuses on the parameterisation, whereas the
mean variables are relevant mainly for computing predictions. For this reason, in the following, we assign a uniform
prior for the mean variables.

We complete the model description specifying distributions

We assign

In this section, we present a novel joint model (referred to

At the core of the model are group-specific latent variables

For the responses we introduce a linear mapping or projection ξ and construct the data-generating latent score (Equation 1) as t(m) = ξ T u(m) , computing a cross product between the u(m) and the mapping ξ.

a (zero-mean) Gaussian distribution,

2.2.1. I NTERPRETATION
After specifying the model, we highlight the role of the
latent variables and the corresponding mappings for the responses and topics, ξ and vk , where k = 1, . . . , K, respectively. We may compute a measure for similarity between
two vectors xi and xj defining a function
xTi xj
l(xi , xj ) = q
(xTi xi )(xTj xj )

We connect the θ
to the latent variables u
by introducing topic-specific mappings vk and gamma-distributed

variables zk (parameterised suitably) such that a priori

whereas shaded nodes correspond to observed variables. Hyperparameters for the root nodes, whose values need to be fixed prior
to posterior inference, are omitted from the visualisation. Plates
indicate replication over topics, groups and words. The hidden
variables may be divided into local group-specific variables and
global variables common to all groups. That is, the unnormalised

scores to infer whether the topics that are positively or negatively associated with excellent or poor ratings.
Next, we present a theoretical justification for the similarity measure. Marginalisation of the latent variables u is
analytically tractable leading to a joint Gaussian distribu(m)
tion for the t(m) and auxiliary variables hk (replacing the
vkT u(m) ). The covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution is
Σ = WWT + I,

where WT = ξ v1 . . . vK .We see that the similarity values defined above correspond to correlations between the response and topical mappings, respectively. We
also note that the distribution is able to capture correlations
between any two topics. Hence, we refer to this model as
joint correlated topic model.
2.2.2. R EGULARISATION
During posterior inference the model infers statistical associations between the groups and responses. The inferred
topics summarise recurring word co-occurrences over the
corpus into interpretable themes some of which may have
significant associations with the ratings. However, for finite sample sizes the correlation structure may be weak.
Accordingly we introduce a user-defined parameter λ > 0,
that balances for the limited sample sizes. Even though, we
expect, when the sample size M increases for fixed vocabulary size V , the role of λ diminishes, since there are more

data to estimate the underlying correlation structure. The
joint likelihood of the model is

the model focuses more on explaining the text.
2.2.3. VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN I NFERENCE
We present a variational Bayesian (VB) (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008) posterior inference algorithm for the model that
scales well for large data collections and can readily be extended to stochastic online learning (Hoffman et al., 2013).
We approximately marginalise over the topic assignments
and proportions using non-trivial factorised distributions,
whereas we use point distributions (estimates) for several
variables to simplify computations, in essence, adopting an
empirical Bayes approach for these variables. The corresponding inference algorithm is able to prune out irrelevant
topics from the model based on the observed data. Full
variational inference would be possible using techniques
presented by Böhning (1992); Jaakkola & Jordan (1997)
and Wang & Blei (2013), for example, lower bounding
analytically intractable log sigmoid function appearing in
the log likelihood function (2). Alternatively, MCMC sampling strategies may provide appealing approaches for posterior inference. However, it is far from trivial to design
suitable proposal distributions for the latent variables.
We introduce a factorised posterior approximation

omitting the point distributions for clarity, and minimise the
KL-divergence between the factorisation q(Θ) and the posterior p(Θ|D). Alternatively, we maximise a lower bound
of the model evidence with respect to the parameters of the
q(Θ),
ln p(D) ≥ LV B = E[ln p(D, Θ)] − E[p(Θ) ln p(Θ)],
where expectations are taken with respect to the q(Θ).
We choose the following distributions for the topic assignments and unnormalised topic proportions

building on Minka’s fixed point iteration (Minka, 2000). In
the denominator, we approximate ψ(x) ≈ ln(x − 1/2),
that is accurate when x > 1. This is the case, since all
w(m) , for m = 1, . . . , M , contain at least one word token.
The asymmetric Dirichlet prior enables pruning irrelevant
topics based on the observed data (Wallach et al., 2009).
We note that due to recursive sampling of the topic assignments computational cost of inference may become considerable for large data sets. The recursive property carries also to a corresponding variational Bayesian treatment,
since the topic assignments are dependent on each other.

3. Related Work
Previous works on statistical models for ordinal data (Albert & Chib, 1993; Chu & Ghahramani, 2005) assume
y (m) = j

if

µj−1 < z (m) ≤ µj ,

z (m) ∼ Normal(t(m) , 1),
where z (m) , for m = 1, . . . , M , denote Gaussiandistributed auxiliary variables. Marginalisation of the z (m)
leads to an ordinal probit model. The corresponding inference algorithm relies on truncated Gaussian distributions
and takes into account explicit ordering constraints for the
mean variables leading to a complicated inference algorithm that is sensitive to initialisation thus potentially leading to local minima.
The original supervised LDA model (SLDA; Blei &
McAuliffe, 2007) uses canonical exponential family distributions for the response model. Under the canonical formulations the expectation of a response variable is
E[y (m) ] = g(t(m) ), where g(·) denotes a link function
specific for each member of the family. Examples of the
most common members of this family include Gaussian,
Bernoulli and Poisson distributions suitable for continuousvalued, binary or count variables, respectively. However,
more importantly, the formulation does not support ordinal
variables.
Previous applications of SLDA by Blei & McAuliffe
(2007); Dai & Storkey (2015) and Nguyen et al. (2013) for

ordinal responses, such as product or movie reviews, have
made a strong model mis-specification; they treat ordinal
variables as continuous-valued. In this approach, the ordinal variables are represented as distinct values in the real
domain with arbitrary user-defined intervals between them,
enabling use of a Gaussian response model. The model is
y (m) ∼ Normal(t(m) +µ, τ −1 ), where µ is a mean variable
and τ is a precision (inverse variance) parameter. There
are a number of statistical flaws in this approach undermining interpretability. First, we note that the mean parameter of the Gaussian distribution, in general, may lead
to results that make no sense in terms of the ordinal categories, especially for non-equidistant between-category intervals. Second, observed ratings still take discrete values but the predictions will not correspond to these values.
Third, the Gaussian error assumption is not supported by
discrete data.
Wang et al. (2009) present an important and non-trivial extension of SLDA to unordered, that is, nominal response
variables, motivated by classification tasks. The nominal
variables represent logically separate concepts that do not
permit ordering.
Ramage et al. (2009) and Lacoste-Julien et al. (2009)
present alternative joint topic models, where functions of
the nominal response variables (class information) affect
topic proportions. The response variables are not explicitly
modelled using generative formulations. The approach by
Mimno & McCallum (2008) uses a similar model formulation suitable for a wide range of observed response variables (or features, in general) performing linear regression
from the responses, which are treated as covariates, to the
concentration parameters of Dirichlet distributions of the
topic proportions. However, it is not obvious how to use
these formulations for ordinal response variables.

4. Experiments and Results
We collect consumer-generated reviews of mobile software
applications (apps) from Apple’s App Store. The review
data for each app contains an ordinal rating taking values
in five categories ranging from poor to excellent as well as
free-flowing text data. We select the vocabulary using tfidf scores. After simple pre-processing, the data collection
contains M = 5511 apps with
PMvocabulary size V = 3995
and total number of words m=1 D(m) = 1.5 × 106 . The
relatively small data collection is chosen to keep algorithm
running times reasonable especially for the sampling-based
inference approaches.

tion 2.3) to SLDA with a Gaussian response model as
adopted in previous work by Blei & McAuliffe (2007); Dai
& Storkey (2015) and Nguyen et al. (2013) (see Section
3 for more details) as well as to sparse ordinal and Gaussian linear regression models. For Gaussian response models we represent the ratings as unit-spaced integers starting
from one. The likelihood-specific parameters for the Gaussian model are mean and precision. We adopt the inference
procedure described in Section 2.3 using collapsed Gibbs
sampling also for Gaussian SLDA. For the regression models we infer a linear combination of the word counts and assign a sparsity-inducing prior distribution for the regression
weights over the vocabulary in order to improve predictive
ability. We maximise the corresponding joint log likelihood
of the model for a fixed prior precision2 . For all the models that use a Gaussian response model, the mean variable
is inferred by computing an empirical response mean. We
initialise the models randomly.
For the joint correlated topic model, referred to as, JTM, we
bound the maximum number of active topics to K = 100,
set dimensionality of the latent variables to L = 30,
α0 = 1, β0 = 10−6 and prior precision to l = L.
The results are shown for λ = 0.001, although, λ ≤ 0.1
provided also good performance with little statistical variation. We terminated the algorithm (both in training and
testing phase), when the relative difference of the (corresponding) lower bound fell below 10−4 . The SLDA models were also computed for K = 100 and we used ζ = 1.
We used 500 sweeps of sampling for inferring the topics
and response parameters. For testing we used 500 sweeps
of collapsed Gibbs sampling. Although we omit formal
time comparisons due to difficulties in comparing VB to
MCMC approaches, we find that the sampling approach
is roughly one order of magnitude slower. In general,
determining convergence for MCMC approaches remains
an open research problem, whereas VB provides a local
bound for model evidence. For all the topic models we
used γ = 0.01. For JTM, this (effectively) equals a topic
Dirichlet concentration parameter value γ + 1 due to point
estimate shifting the value by minus one. For the regression models we sidestep proper cross-validation of the prior
precision and show results for the values providing the best
performance, potentially leading to over-optimistic results.
4.2. Rating Prediction
We evaluate the models quantitatively in terms of predictive ability. Even though the developed joint mixed membership models are formulated primarily for exploring sta2
We use t(m)
=
ξT x(m) , where x(m) denotes
word counts over the V -dimensional vocabulary, and
QV
p(ξ|) ∝
d=1 exp(− ln(cosh(ξd ))), where  denotes a
precision parameter of the prior distribution.

tistical associations between the ratings and text data, they
can readily be used as predictive models. More specifically,
we predict the ordinal rating based on the text. We partition available data into multiple training and test sets using 10-fold cross validation. For each model (and fold) we
compute the test-set log likelihood (probability) of ratings
(the higher, the better) and use these values for comparison.
Despite various predictive criteria have been proposed, the
selected measure is well motivated by statistical modelling.
In the test phase, for JTM, we infer the latent variables u,
topic proportions (unnormalised gamma-distributed vari(m)
(m)
ables zk ) and topic assignments cd given the values
for the remaining parameters inferred in the training phase.
For SLDA models the test phase corresponds to estimating
the topic assignments using standard LDA model algorithm
(using collapsed Gibbs sampling) with fixed topics inferred
based on the training data. Finally, we compute the corresponding latent scores t(m) for the models, obtaining the
predictions.
Table 1 shows the test-set log likelihoods for the models. The ordinal linear regression model resulted in significantly better predictions than the Gaussian regression
model (paired one-sided Wilcoxon; p < 10−3 ) showing
that it is important to substitute a statistically poorly motivated Gaussian response distribution with a proper generative model. For both models the sparsity assumption improves predictive ability. For the ordinal regression model,
the most relevant words predictive of low (poor) ratings
include waste and free and those of high (excellent) ratings include amazing and perfect. The model, however,
falls short in providing in-depth interpretations, necessitating the use of topic models.
All the topic models perform substantially better than
the regression models. The ordinal SLDA model provides the best predictive performance, JTM is the second
best and Gaussian SLDA is the worst. All (pair-wise)
comparisons are statistically significant (paired one-sided
Wilcoxon; p < 0.005). We discovered K = 100 is a
sufficiently large threshold value for the number of topics; some of the inferred topics are inactive. This, together with good predictive accuracy, establish evidence
the developed models have captured the relevant statistical variation in the observed data. For JTM, we also performed a sensitivity analysis of the dimensionality of the
latent variables L and found little statistical variation for
30 ≤ L ≤ 100 = K. The test log likelihoods range
between a minimum of −669.42(9.68) for L = 80 and a
maximum of −661.98(11.73) for L = 50.
Next, we compared the inferred topics of different models quantitatively using a measure, referred to as, semantic
coherence proposed by Mimno et al. (2011) for quantifying topic trustworthiness. Table 2 shows the average topic

One of the topics associated with high ratings (Figure 4)
captures word co-occurrence patterns containing adjectives
with positive semantics. The remaining topics capture
themes customers appreciate, such as games, health monitoring, calculations (for example, for unit conversions),
learning languages, social networking and education. One
of the topics captures positive customer feedback about app
interface and design.

Figure 5. Visual illustration of topics associated with low ratings.

Finally, we visualise and interpret the topics inferred by the
JTM model. Figures 4 and 5 visualise nine topics associated with high (excellent) and low (poor) ratings, respectively. As explained in Section 2.2.1, the associations (both
sign and strength) are given by computing the similarity
scores (that is, correlations).

The topics associated with low ratings (Figure 5) contain
customers’ negative experiences or feature requests such
as removal of adds, software updates and problems with
functionality.

In this work, we develop a new class of ordinal mixed membership models suitable for capturing statistical associations between groups of observations and co-occurring ordinal response variables for each group. We depart from the
existing dominant approach that relies on improper model
assumptions for the ordinal response variables. We successfully demonstrate the developed models for analysing
reviews of mobile software applications provided by consumers. The proposed class of models as well as inference
approaches are applicable for a wide range of present-day
applications. In the future, we expect to see improvements
in statistical inference including fully Bayesian treatments
and nonparametric Bayesian formulations. Stochastic online learning or model formulations for streaming data may
be applied to scale the statistical inference to cope with current data repositories containing review data for a few millions of groups.
