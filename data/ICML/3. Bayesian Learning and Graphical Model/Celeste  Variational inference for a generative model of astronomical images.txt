Abstract
We present a new, fully generative model of optical telescope image sets, along with a variational procedure for inference. Each pixel intensity is treated as a Poisson random variable, with
a rate parameter dependent on latent properties
of stars and galaxies. Key latent properties are
themselves random, with scientific prior distributions constructed from large ancillary data sets.
We check our approach on synthetic images. We
also run it on images from a major sky survey,
where it exceeds the performance of the current
state-of-the-art method for locating celestial bodies and measuring their colors.

1. Introduction
This paper presents Celeste, a new, fully generative model
of astronomical image sets‚Äîthe first such model to be empirically investigated, to our knowledge. The work we
report is an encouraging example of principled statistical
inference applied successfully to a science domain underserved by the machine learning community. It is unfortunate that astronomy and cosmology receive comparatively
little of our attention: the scientific questions are fundamental, there are petabytes of data available, and we as a
data-analysis community have a lot to offer the domain scientists. One goal in reporting this work is to raise the profile
of these problems for the machine-learning audience and
show that much interesting research remains to be done.
Turn now to the science. Stars and galaxies radiate photons.
An astronomical image records photons‚Äîeach originating

stars from our own galaxy.

from a particular celestial body or from background atmospheric noise‚Äîthat pass through a telescope‚Äôs lens during an exposure. Multiple celestial bodies may contribute
photons to a single image (e.g. Figure 1), and even to a
single pixel of an image. Locating and characterizing the
imaged celestial bodies is an inference problem central to
astronomy. To date, the algorithms proposed for this inference problem have been primarily heuristic, based on
finding bright regions in the images (Lupton et al., 2001;
Stoughton et al., 2002).
Generative models are well-suited to this problem‚Äîfor
three reasons. First, to a good approximation, photon
counts from celestial objects are independent Poisson processes: each star or galaxy has an intrinsic brightness that

Celeste

is effectively static during human time scales. In an imaging exposure, the expected count of photons entering the
telescope‚Äôs lens from a particular object is proportional to
its brightness. When multiple objects contribute photons to
the same pixel, their rates combine additively.
Second, many sources of prior information about celestial
bodies are available, but none is definitive. Stars tend to
be brighter than galaxies, but many stars are dim and many
galaxies are bright. Stars tend to be smaller than galaxies, but many galaxies appear point-like as well. Stars and
galaxies differ greatly in how their radiation is distributed
over the visible spectrum: stars are well approximated by
an ‚Äúideal blackbody law‚Äù depending only on their temperature, while galaxies are not. On the other hand, stars are not
actually ideal blackbodies, and galaxies do emit energy in
the same wavelengths as stars. Posterior inference in a generative model provides a principled way to integrate these
various sources of prior information.
Third, even the most powerful telescopes receive just a
handful of photons per exposure from many celestial objects. Hence, many objects cannot be precisely located,
classified, or otherwise characterized from the data available. Quantifying the uncertainty of point estimates is
essential‚Äîit is often as important as the accuracy of the
point estimates themselves. Uncertainty quantification is a
natural strength of the generative modeling framework.
Some astronomical software uses probabilities in a heuristic fashion (Bertin & Arnouts, 1996), and a generative
model has been developed for measuring galaxy shapes
(Miller et al., 2013)‚Äîa subproblem of ours. But, to our
knowledge, fully generative models for inferring celestial
bodies‚Äô locations and characteristics have not yet been examined.1 Difficulty scaling the inference for expressive
generative models may have hampered their development,
as astronomical sky surveys produce very large amounts
of data. For example, the Dark Energy Survey‚Äôs 570megapixel digital camera, mounted on a four-meter telescope in the Andes, captures 300 gigabytes of sky images every night (Dark Energy Survey, 2015). Once completed, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will house a
3200-megapixel camera producing eight terabytes of images nightly (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Consortium, 2014).
The rest of the paper describes the Celeste model (Section 2) and its accompanying variational inference procedure (Section 3). Section 4 details our empirical studies on
synthetic data as well as a sizable collection of astronomical images.

proposing such a model.

2. The model
The Celeste model is represented graphically in Figure 2.
In this section we describe how Celeste relates celestial
bodies‚Äô latent characteristics to the observed pixel intensities in each image.
2.1. Celestial bodies
Celeste is a hierarchical model, with celestial objects atop
pixels. For each object s D 1; : : : ; S , the unknown 2-vector
s encodes its position in the sky as seen from earth. In Celeste, every celestial body is either a star or a galaxy. (In the
present work, we ignore other types of objects, which are
comparatively rare.) The latent Bernoulli random variable
as encodes object type: as D 1 for a galaxy, as D 0 for a
star. We set the prior distribution
as  Bernoulli.Àö /:

processed to other energies through interactions with dust
and gas. (Figure 3) demonstrates that stars are much nearer
a 1-dimensional manifold in color space than galaxies are.
We model the prior distribution on cs as a mixture of D
multivariate Gaussians. The number of mixture components D may be selected to minimize error on held out
data, or kept small for computational efficiency. The random categorical variable ks indicates which mixture component generated cs . A priori,

2.1.1. B RIGHTNESS
The overall brightness of a celestial object s is quantified as
the total radiation from s expected to reach a unit area of the
earth‚Äôs surface, directly facing s, per unit of time. However,
we can also quantify brightness as the proportion of this radiation (per square meter, per second) that passes through
each filter in a standardized filter set. Such a set is called
a ‚Äúphotometric system.‚Äù These standardized filters are approximately band-pass: each allows most of the energy in a
certain band of wavelengths through, while blocking most
of the energy outside the band. The physical filters attached
to a telescope lens closely match the standardized filters of
some photometric system.
In Celeste, we take the photometric-system approach‚Äîwe
directly model brightnesses with respect to the B filters of
a fixed photometric system. We designate a particular filter as the ‚Äúreference‚Äù filter, letting the random variable rs
denote the brightness of object s with respect to that filter.
We make rs dependent on as , since stars tend to be brighter
than galaxies. For computational convenience, and because
brightness is typically considered to be non-negative and
real-valued, we set


rs j.as D i /  Gamma  .i / ; 	 .i / :
(2)
Object s‚Äôs brightnesses with respect to the remaining B 1
filters are encoded using ‚Äúcolors.‚Äù The color csb is defined
as the log ratio of brightnesses with respect to filters b and
b C 1. Here, the filters are ordered by the wavelength bands
they let through. The B 1 colors for object s are collectively denoted by cs , a random .B 1/-vector.
Celeste uses the color parameterization because stars and
galaxies have very distinct prior distributions in color
space. Indeed, for idealized stars‚Äîblackbodies‚Äîall B 1
colors lie on a one-dimensional manifold indexed by surface temperature. On the other hand, though galaxies are
composed of stars, theory does not suggest they lie near the
same manifold: the stars in a galaxy can have many different surface temperatures, and some of the photons are re-

2.1.2. G ALAXIES
The distance from earth to any star (besides the sun) exceeds the star‚Äôs radius by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, stars are well modeled as points. Modeling the (twodimensional) appearance of galaxies as seen from earth is
more involved. We divide the appearance of galaxy s into
two parts: its per-filter brightnesses .`sb /, as discussed in
Section 2.1.1, and its ‚Äúlight kernel‚Äù hs .w/, which describes
how the apparent radiation from the galaxy is distributed
over the sky. The argument w is in sky coordinates; the
light kernel is a density function that integrates to one and
is largest near the apparent galactic center. In Section 2.1.3,
we show how these two parts of apparent galaxy brightness
come together.
We take hs .w/ to be a convex combination of two prototype
functions, known in astronomy as the ‚Äúexponential‚Äù and
‚Äúde Vaucouleurs‚Äù prototypes:
hs .w/ D s hs1 .w/ C .1

s /hs2 .w/;

s 2 ≈í0; 1¬ç: (5)

The de Vaucouleurs prototype is characteristic of ‚Äúelliptical‚Äù galaxies, which have smooth light kernels (Figure 5),
whereas the exponential prototype matches ‚Äúspiral‚Äù galaxies (Figure 1). The prototype functions hs1 .w/ and hs2 .w/
contain additional galaxy-specific parameters. In particular, each prototype function is a rotated, scaled mixture of
bivariate normal distributions. The rotation and scaling are
galaxy-specific, but the remaining parameters of each mixture are not:

The developments of the previous sections represent the
sky without these concerns; we call this part of the model

brightness (the ideal sky view) in filter b, at sky position w,

The light kernel hs .w/ is a finite scale mixture of Gaussians: its mixture components have a common mean s
and covariance matrices that differ only in scale. The
‚Äúisophotes‚Äù (level sets of the light kernel) are concentric
ellipses. Although this model prevents us from fitting individual ‚Äúarms,‚Äù like those of the galaxy in Figure 1,
most galaxies are not sufficiently resolved to see such substructure. (See Figure 4 for a typical galaxy image.) A
more flexible galaxy model might overfit them.

Returning to the Celeste graphical model, the data is represented in the bottom half of Figure 2. A ‚Äúfield‚Äù is a small,
rectangular region of the sky. Fields may overlap. Each
of the N fields in the data set is imaged B times, once per
filter in the photometric system (Section 2.1.1).2
Each resulting image is a grid of M pixels. Each pixel
in turn receives light primarily from celestial bodies near
the pixel‚Äôs corresponding region of the sky. The observed
random variable xnbm is the count of photons recorded at
pixel m, in image b of field n.
The night sky is not completely dark owing to natural skyglow, a combination of reflected sunlight off dust particles in the solar system, night airglow from molecules in
the earth‚Äôs atmosphere, and scattered starlight and moonlight. We model the night sky‚Äôs brightness as background
noise, through a spatial Poisson process that is homogeneous for each image and independent of stars and galaxies. The noise rate depends on the image and the band because atmospheric conditions vary over time. Also, the atmospheric effects differ for imaging targets closer to the
horizon. The image-specific constant Nnb denotes the rate
of background noise.
Both Nnb and the brightnesses of celestial bodies are quantified in linear units of nanomaggies‚Äîa physical unit of
energy, not specific to any particular image (SDSS DR10,
2015). The image-specific constant Nnb is the expected
number of photons recorded in image b of field n, for a
pixel receiving a brightness of one nanomaggy.

2.1.3. T HE IDEAL SKY VIEW

Ground-based astronomical images are blurred by a combination of small-angle scattering in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere,

In the upcoming Section 2.2, we account for distortions
from pixelation, atmospheric blur, and background noise;
and we deal in photons counted by a camera, rather than
continuous-valued brightness (energy arriving at earth).

2 Cameras for optical astronomy typically use charge-coupled
devices (CCDs), which convert light into electrons (Dark Energy
Survey, 2015). A CCD is a grid of millions of pixels, designed to
sum the radiation arriving at each pixel during an exposure.

the diffraction limit of the telescope, optical distortions in
the camera, and charge diffusion within the silicon of the
CCD detectors. Together these effects are represented by
the ‚Äúpoint spread function‚Äù (PSF) of a given image. Stars
(other than the sun) are points in the ideal sky view (Section 2.1.3), but the PSF typically spreads their photons over
dozens of adjacent pixels.
When dealing with images, as in this section, we work in
the image coordinate system. For any single image, there is
a one-to-one mapping between image and sky coordinates,
so nothing is lost; our notation suppresses the mapping for
clarity.
We model the action of the PSF as a mixture of K Gaussians. Consider pixel m (in band b of image n), having
coordinates wm . The probability that a photon originating
at coordinates w lands at wm is given by the PSF

3. Inference
In this section we explain how we apply the Celeste model
to astronomical image data sets, to draw inferences about
unknown quantities.
In principle, all parameters could be learned by variational
inference. But we reuse some estimates from the existing photometric pipeline that are not thought to limit performance. The background noise level Nbn is set by the
existing photometric pipeline, based on a heuristic: most
pixels in each image receive photons primarily from background radiation. The calibration constant Nbn is set by
first calibrating overlapping images relative to each other,
and then by calibrating some images absolutely, based
on benchmark stars (Padmanabhan et al., 2008). The
image-specific parameters of the point spread function,
.ÀõN nb ; N nb ; Nnb /K
, are set by the existing photometric
kD1
pipeline; a mixture of Gaussians is fit to known stars (considered point sources, before convolution with the PSF) in
each image that are not near other celestial objects.
Galaxy profiles‚Äô parameters, .N ij ; N ij /jJD1 , are set a priori
too, by fitting mixtures of Gaussians to SeÃÅrsic profiles‚Äî
widely used models of galaxy profiles. We fit J D 8component mixtures for de Vaucouleurs galaxies (i D 1)
and J D 6-component mixtures for exponential galaxies
(i D 2). These approximations are good enough for the
current version of the model: the misfit versus SeÃÅrsic profiles is smaller than the misfit between SeÃÅrsic profiles and
actual galaxies.
The prior distributions also could be learned within the
variational procedure, by empirical Bayes. But, because
much data is available in existing astronomical catalogs,
we estimate their parameters a priori. Fitting Àö,  , and
 by maximum likelihood to existing catalogs is straightforward. To fit the prior on color .cs / to existing catalogs,
we use the expectation-maximization algorithm, initialized
by k-means (van Leeuwen, 2015). Though D D 64 minimized held-out test error, we set D D 2, to work around
a limitation of our present optimizer‚Äîit only supports box
constraints. Figure 3 shows a two-dimensional slice of the
.B 1/-dimensional data set used to construct the color
prior.

Celeste

The remaining quantities are estimated by variational inference.

One expectation is not analytic. We approximate it by replacing a logarithm with its second-order Taylor expansion:

where Vq denotes variance with respect to q. This
technique is known as delta-method variational inference (Braun & McAuliffe, 2010; Wang & Blei, 2013). Because znbm is a sum over celestial bodies, whose corresponding random variables are treated as independent in q,
the computational complexity of the approximation scales

Once the expectations in the ELBO are replaced with analytic expressions, maximizing it becomes a standard optimization problem, amenable to various techniques. We use
L-BFGS-B (Byrd et al., 1995).
When possible, we use existing star and galaxy catalogs
for initialization. When no catalog is suitable, we convolve
the images with matched filters to increase the signal-tonoise ratio (North, 1963). We find each pixel whose value
exceeds both the values of its neighboring pixels and an upper bound on the number of photons that could come from
sky noise. We initialize the center of each such pixel as a
celestial object. The number of such pixels determines S ,
the number of objects we assume are present in the image.
Modeling S as random is the subject of ongoing research.
We compute derivatives alongside the evaluation of the objective, with little overhead: results for the most computationally expensive operations required to evaluate the objective, like exponentiation, can be reused for evaluating
the derivative. We have not found the speed of automatic
differentiation toolkits competitive with manually coded
derivatives, so our current results use the latter. Validating
manually derived derivatives against approximations from
numeric differentiation is essential.
To get a feel for the scale of the computation, consider how
we produced the results in the next section. The objective and its derivative are summations over pixels (Equation (29)). At each pixel, for each nearby celestial body, we
evaluate 45 Gaussian densities, to compute the quantities in
Equations (15) and (17). In the model, every celestial body
can contribute photons to every pixel. In practice, we truncate these Gaussians. Most stars and galaxies contribute

Celeste

photons to fewer than 100 pixels, and no pixels are thought
to receive photons from more than 10 celestial bodies.
With these techniques, evaluating the ELBO takes several
seconds on a 2000-pixel image containing a few celestial
bodies, and roughly 5 minutes on a 4-megapixel image with
hundreds of celestial bodies. The calculation for a single
image could be parallelized, though instead we elect to process images in parallel, on separate processors.

4. Experiments
For real astronomical images, ground truth is unknown.
However, a region of the sky known as ‚ÄúStripe 82‚Äù has
been imaged more than 30 times by modern telescopes,
whereas most of the sky has been imaged through all five
filter bands of our chosen photometric system just once.
‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù (Lupton et al., 2001; Lupton, 2005) is the current
state of the art for detection and characterization of celestial bodies. We henceforth refer to Photo, limited to just
one image in each band, as ‚ÄúPrimary,‚Äù and Photo run on
the complete collection of replicated Stripe 82 images as
‚ÄúCoadd.‚Äù Coadd serves as the ground truth in our subsequent analysis. However: (1) any systematic biases in the
Photo software are shared by both Coadd and Primary, and
(2) the composition of images taken through different atmospheric conditions can create its own biases. Nonetheless, with predictions based on at least 30 times more data,
we expect that Coadd accurately characterizes any celestial
body detected by either Primary or Celeste.
We compare Celeste to Primary on 654 celestial bodies
from Stripe 82, selected based on Coadd (the ground truth),
that were not so bright as to be trivial to detect, but not
so dim as to be impossible to detect. The data are sets of
B D 5 images, called ‚Äústamps‚Äù, each centered on a selected celestial body. For these experiments, stamps substitute for fields in Figure 2. Unlike fields, the stamps do
not overlap, and a celestial body appearing in one stamp
does not contribute photons to other stamps that we analyze. Multiple celestial bodies contribute photons to most
stamps.
We initialize Celeste to the output of Primary, so that we
can assess the marginal improvement obtained from our inference procedure. Results appear in Table 1.
Sample size varies by row because the galaxy models for
Celeste and Photo are not always comparable: both fit
exponential and de Vaucouleurs light-kernel prototypes to
each galaxy, but in Celeste both prototypes are constrained
to have the same rotation and scaling applied to them.
Hence, for rotation and scaling measures, we only compare
using galaxies where Coadd puts all the mixing weight on
one of the two prototypes.

Primary (Photo) is a carefully hand-tuned heuristic. Yet,
Celeste matches or improves Photo on most metrics; only
for reference-band brightness and scale is Celeste worse
by more than two standard errors. This result comes on a
data set of difficult celestial bodies, with ground truth set
by Photo itself. For each color, Celeste reduces Primary‚Äôs
error, making Celeste (initialized by Photo) state-of-the-art
for color detection. Whereas Primary estimates each filter band‚Äôs brightness independently, Celeste predicts band
brightnesses jointly, and regularizes these predictions based
on prior information.
Celeste significantly outperforms Primary for position too.
The 9.8% (+/- 2.0%) smaller position error is of practical
importance to astronomers.
4.1. Synthetic images
To gauge the extent to which Celeste‚Äôs performance is limited by model misfit, or by errors in Coadd (the ground
truth), we also test Celeste with synthetic images. For each
real image, we generate a synthetic image with the same
properties, with the locations, celestial object types, and
reference band bright of the celestial bodies set to Coadd,
but with the colors and pixel values drawn from our model.
For each synthetic image, we initialize Celeste to the predictions from Primary (run on the real images, not the synthetic images).
We would like to also test Photo on the synthetic images.
Running Photo on new data, however, rather than using
the catalogs from former runs of Photo, exceeds our capacity; Photo is a long, intricate hand-tuned pipeline that has
not been compiled in 6 years. Comparing the results for
Celeste on synthetic data to Primary is nonetheless informative, since the synthetic data mirrors Coadd (the ground
truth).
For position, brightness, color, and all 4 properties of
galaxies, we see large reductions in error by Celeste from
using synthetic images rather than real images. The number of galaxies we misclassify as stars, and vice versa, is
also reduced.
4.2. Uncertainty quantification
Celeste is fairly certain (1% uncertainty) about the classification (star vs. galaxy) for 526 out of 573 celestial objects. Of these classifications, 4% are wrong. Of the remaining classifications (>1% uncertainty), 45% are wrong.
For brightness and each of the four colors, observed error
rates also correlate directly with reported uncertainty (Table 2). This correlation holds for synthetic data too.

4.3. Model misfit
On real data, galaxy model misfit may have constrained
Celeste‚Äôs performance across the board. Celeste‚Äôs twocomponent galaxy model is based on the successful models
from Lang & Hogg (2015) and Miller et al. (2013). However, Celeste is a fully generative model, so any misfit between the modeled galaxy and the actual galaxy must be
explained by Poisson randomness. The Poisson process is
well-suited to modeling the variation in photon count when
the underlying rate is correct. But, for galaxies, the rate
itself may deviate greatly from the model. With this type

of model misfit, the galaxy shape that optimizes the ELBO
may be unduly influenced by irregularities in the underlying rate. Figure 6 illustrates a galaxy that would be difficult
to fit with any simple parametric model, even if sampled at
low spatial resolution. Enhancing Celeste‚Äôs galaxy model
is a promising direction of ongoing research.
Modeling the galaxy-specific parameters (s , 's , s , and
s ) as constants to be learned rather than as random variables with prior distributions likely also worsen performance. In some cases galaxies scales‚Äô .s / were much too
large; the optimizer may have been using a galaxy to explain a background noise rate that exceeded nb . These
cases likely explain why Primary outperformed Celeste in
determining brightness and scale. Though the underlying
issue is model misfit (as Celeste‚Äôs good performance on
synthetic data suggests), constraining s with a prior distribution could mitigate this effect. Also, a model that assigns more degrees of freedom to galaxies‚Äîunconstrained
by prior distributions‚Äîthan stars biases the classification
in favor of galaxies. Treating all unknown quantities in Celeste as random is the subject of ongoing research.
