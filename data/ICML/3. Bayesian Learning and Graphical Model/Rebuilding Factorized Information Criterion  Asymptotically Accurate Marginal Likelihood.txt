Abstract
Factorized information criterion (FIC) is a recently developed approximation technique for
the marginal log-likelihood, which provides an
automatic model selection framework for a few
latent variable models (LVMs) with tractable inference algorithms. This paper reconsiders FIC
and ﬁlls theoretical gaps of previous FIC studies.
First, we reveal the core idea of FIC that allows
generalization for a broader class of LVMs. Second, we investigate the model selection mechanism of the generalized FIC, which we provide
a formal justiﬁcation of FIC as a model selection criterion for LVMs and also a systematic
procedure for pruning redundant latent variables.
Third, we uncover a few previously-unknown relationships between FIC and the variational free
energy. A demonstrative study on Bayesian principal component analysis is provided and numerical experiments support our theoretical results.

1. Introduction
The marginal log-likelihood is a key concept of Bayesian
model identiﬁcation of latent variable models (LVMs),
such as mixture models (MMs), probabilistic principal
component analysis, and hidden Markov models (HMMs).
Determination of dimensionality of latent variables is an
essential task to uncover hidden structures behind the observed data as well as to mitigate overﬁtting. In general, LVMs are singular (i.e., mapping between paramProceedings of the 32 nd International Conference on Machine
Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).

eters and probabilistic models is not one-to-one) and
such classical information criteria based on the regularity assumption as the Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) are no longer justiﬁed. Since exact evaluation of the marginal log-likelihood is often not
available, approximation techniques have been developed
using sampling (i.e., Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMCs) (Hastings, 1970)), a variational lower bound
(i.e., the variational Bayes methods (VB) (Attias, 1999;
Jordan et al., 1999)), or algebraic geometry (i.e., the widely
applicable BIC (WBIC) (Watanabe, 2013)). However,
model selection using these methods requires heavy computational cost (e.g., a large number of MCMC sampling in
a high-dimensional space, an outer loop for WBIC.)
In the last few years, a new approximation technique
and an inference method, factorized information criterion (FIC) and factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference (FAB), have been developed for some binary
LVMs (Fujimaki & Morinaga, 2012; Fujimaki & Hayashi,
2012; Hayashi & Fujimaki, 2013; Eto et al., 2014;
Liu et al., 2015). Unlike existing methods that evaluate
approximated marginal log-likelihoods calculated for
each latent variable dimensionality (and therefore need an
outer loop for model selection), FAB ﬁnds an effective
dimensionality via an EM-style alternating optimization
procedure.
For example, let us consider a K-component MM for N
observations X> = (x1 , . . . , xN ) with one-of-K coding
latent variables Z> = (z1 , . . . , zN ), mixing coefﬁcients
β = (β1 , . . . , βK ), and DΞ -dimensional component-wise
parameters Ξ = {ξ1 , . . . , ξK }. By using Laplace’s
method to the marginalization of the log-likelihood, FIC

of MMs (Fujimaki & Morinaga, 2012) is derived by

is the total dimension of Ξ and β, and H(q) is the entropy
of q. A key characteristic of FIC can be observed in the
second term of Eq. (1), which gives the penalty in terms
of model complexity.
As we can see, the penalty term
∑
decreases when
z
n nk —the number of effective samples of the k-th component—is small, i.e., Z is degenerated. Therefore, through the optimization of q, the degenerate dimension is automatically pruned until a nondegenerated Z is found. This mechanism makes FAB a
one-pass model selection algorithm and computationally
more attractive than the other methods. The validity of the
penalty term has been conﬁrmed for other binary LVMs,
e.g., HMMs (Fujimaki & Hayashi, 2012), latent feature
models (Hayashi & Fujimaki, 2013), and mixture of experts (Eto et al., 2014).
Despite FAB’s practical success compared with BIC and
VB, it is unclear that what conditions are actually necessary to guarantee that FAB yields the true latent variable
dimensionality. In addition, the generalization of FIC for
non-binary LVMs remains an important issue.
∑In case that
Z takes negative and/or continuous values, n znk is no
longer interpretable as the number of effective samples, and
we loose the clue for ﬁnding the redundant dimension of Z.
This paper proposes generalized FIC (gFIC), given by
gFIC(K) ≡Eq∗ [L(Z, Π̂, K)] + H(q),

Here, q ∗ (Z) ≡ p(Z|X, K) is the marginal posterior and
FΞ̂ is the Hessian matrix of − ln p(X, Z|Π, K)/N with respect to Ξ. In gFIC, the penalty term is given by the volume
of the (empirical) Fisher information matrix, which naturally penalizes model complexity even for continuous latent variables. Accordingly, gFIC is applicable to a broader
class of LVMs, such as Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) (Bishop, 1998).
Furthermore, we prove that FAB automatically prunes
redundant dimensionality along with optimizing q, and
gFIC for the optimized q asymptotically converges to the

by argmaxΘ p(X, Z|Θ) while the MAP is given by

marginal log-likelihood with a constant order error under
some reasonable assumptions. This justiﬁes gFIC as a
model selection criterion for LVMs and further a natural
one-pass model “pruning” procedure is derived, which is
performed heuristically in previous FIC studies. We also
provide an interpretation of gFIC as a variational free energy and uncover a few previously-unknown relationships
between them. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of gFIC
by applying it to BPCA. The experimental results agree
with to the theoretical properties of gFIC.

2. LVMs and Degeneration
We ﬁrst deﬁne the class of LVMs we deal with in this paper.
Here, we consider LVMs that have K-dimensional latent
variables zn (including the MMs in the previous section),
but now zn can take not only binary but also real values.
Given X and a model family (e.g., MMs), our goal is to
determine K and we refer to this as a model. Note that we
sometimes omit the notation K for the sake of brevity, if it
is obvious from the context.
The LVMs have DΞ -dimensional component-dependent
parameters Ξ = {ξ 1 , . . . , ξ K } and DΘ -dimensional
component-independent parameters Θ, which include hyperparameters of the prior of Z. We abbreviate them
as Π = {Θ, Ξ} and assume the dimension DΠ =
DΘ + DΞ is ﬁnite. Then, we deﬁne the joint probability: p(X, Z, Π) = p(X|Z, Π)p(Z|Π)p(Π) where
ln p(X, Z|Π) is twice differentiable at Π ∈ P. Let FΠ ≡

Note that the MJLE Π̂ ≡ argmaxΠ ln p(X, Z | Π) depends on Z (and X). In addition, ln p(X, Z | Π) can have
multiple maximizers, and Π̂ could be a set of solutions.
Model redundancy is a notable property of LVMs. Because the latent variable Z is unobservable, the pair (Z, Π)
is not necessarily determined uniquely for a given X. In
other words, there could be pairs (Z, Π) and (Z̃, Π̃), whose
likelihoods have the same value, i.e., p(X, Z | Π, K) =
p(X, Z̃ | Π̃, K). In such case, the model possibly has multiple maxima, and the conventional asymptotic analysis is
no longer valid (Watanabe, 2009).
Previous FIC studies address this redundancy by introducing a variational representation that enables treating Z as
ﬁxed, as we explain in the next section. However, even if
Z is ﬁxed, the redundancy still remains, namely, the case
in which Z is singular or “degenerated,” and there exists an
equivalent likelihood with a smaller model K 0 < K:
p(X, Z | Π, K) = p(X, Z̃K 0 | Π̃K 0 , K 0 ).

(3)

In this case, K is overcomplete for Z, and Z lies on the

Rebuilding Factorized Information Criterion

subspace of the model K. As a simple example, let us consider a three-component MM for which Z = (z, 1 − z, 0).
In this case, ξ3 is unidentiﬁable, because the third component is completely unused, and the K 0 = 2-component
MM with Z̃2 ≡ (z, 1 − z) and Π̃2 ≡ (Θ, (ξ1 , ξ 2 )) satisﬁes equivalence relation (3). The notion of degeneration is
deﬁned formally as follows.
Deﬁnition 1. Given X and K, Z is degenerated if there are
multiple MJLEs and any FΠ̂ of the MJLEs are not positive
deﬁnite. Similarly, p(Z) is degenerated in distribution, if
Ep [FΠ̂ ] are not positive deﬁnite. Let κ(Z) ≡ rank(FΠ̂ )
and κ(p) ≡ rank(Ep [FΠ̂ ]).
The idea of degeneration is conceptually understandable as
an analogous of linear algebra. Namely, each component of
a model is a “basis”, Z are “coordinates”, and κ(Z) is the
number of necessary components to represent X, i.e., the
“rank” of X in terms of the model family. The degeneration
of Z is then the same idea of the “degeneration” in linear
algebra, i.e., the number of components is too many and Π
is not uniquely determined even if Z is ﬁxed.
As discussed later, given a degenerated Z where κ(Z) =
K 0 , ﬁnding the equivalent parameters Z̃K 0 and Π̃K 0 that
satisfy Eq. (3) is an important task. In order to analyze this,
we assume A1): for any degenerated Z under a model K ≥
2 and K 0 < K, there exists a continuous onto mapping
(Z, Π) → (Z̃K 0 , Π̃K 0 ) that satisﬁes Eq. (3), and Z̃K 0 is
not degenerated. Note that, if P is a subspace of RDΠ , a
linear projection V : RDΠ 7→ RDΠK 0 satisﬁes A1 where
V is the top-DΠK 0 eigenvectors of FΠ . This is veriﬁed
easily by the fact that, by using the chain rule, FΠ̃K 0 =
VFΠ̂ V> , which is a diagonal matrix whose elements are
positive eigenvalues. Therefore, FΠ̃K 0 is positive deﬁnite
and Z̃K 0 is not degenerated.
Let us further introduce a few assumptions required to
show the asymptotic properties of gFIC. Suppose A2) the
joint distribution is mutually independent in sample-wise,
∏
p(X, Z | Π, K) =
p(xn , zn | Π, K),
(4)
n

and A3) ln p(Π | K) is constant, i.e., limN →∞ ln p(Π |
K)/N = 0. In addition, A4) p(Π | K) is continuous,
not improper, and its support P is compact and the whole
space. Note that for almost all Z, we expect that Π̂ ∈ P is
uniquely determined and FΠ̂ is positive deﬁnite, i.e., A5)
if Z is not degenerated, then ln p(X, Z | Π, K) is concave
and det |FΠ̂ | < ∞.
2.1. Examples of the LVM Class
The above deﬁnition covers a broad class of LVMs. Here,
we show that, as examples, MMs and BPCA are included in
that class. Note that A2 does not allow correlation among

samples and analysis of cases with sample correlation (e.g.
time series models) remains as an open problem.
MMs In the same notation used in Section 1,
the
is given by p(X, Z|Π)

∏ ∏joint likelihood znk
where pk is the density of
n

component k. If ξ1 , . . . , ξK have no overlap, FΞ is
the block-diagonal
matrix whose block is given by
∑
Fξk = − n ∇∇ ln pk (xn |ξk )znk /N . This shows that
the MM is degenerated, when more than one column
of Z is ﬁlled by zero. For that case, removing such
columns and corresponding ξ k sufﬁces as Z̃K 0 and
Π̃K 0 in A1. Note that if pk is an exponential-family
distribution exp(x>
n ξ k − ψ(ξ k )), −∇∇ ln pk (xn |ξ k ) =
∇∇ψ(ξk ) = C does not depend on n and gFIC

BPCA Suppose X ∈ RN ×D is centerized, i.e., n xn =
0. Then, the joint likelihood
of X and Z ∈ RN ×K is
∏
given by p(X, Z|Π) = n N (xn |Wzn , λ1 I)N (zn |0, I),
where Ξ = W = (w·1 , . . . , w·K ) is a linear basis and
Θ = λ is the reciprocal of the noise variance. Note that
the original study of BPCA ∏
(Bishop, 1998) introduces the
additional priors p(W) = d N (wd |0, diag(α−1 )) and
p(λ)
= Gamma(λ|aλ , bλ ) and the hyperprior p(α) =
∏
k Gamma(αk |aα , bα ). In this paper, however, we do
not specify explicit forms of those priors but just treat them
as an O(1) term.
Since there is no second-order interaction between wi and
wj6=i , the Hessian FΞ is a block-diagonal and each block

and Z is degenerated, if rank(Z) < K. Suppose that Z is
degenerated, let K 0 = rank(Z) < K, and let the SVD be
Z = Udiag(σ)V> = (UK 0 , 0)diag(σ K 0 , 0)(VK 0 , 0)> ,
where UK 0 and VK 0 are K 0 non-zero singular vectors and
σ K 0 is K 0 non-zero singular values. From the deﬁnition of
FΞ , the projection V removes the degeneration of Z, i.e.,
by letting Z̃ = ZV and W̃ = WV,

3. Derivation of gFIC
To obtain p(X | K), we need to marginalize out two variables: Z and Π. Let us consider the variational form for Z,
written as
ln p(X|K) =Eq [ln p(X, Z|K)] + H(q) + KL(qkq ∗ ) (6)
=Eq∗ [ln p(X, Z|K)] + H(q ∗ ),
(7)
∫
where KL(qkp) = q(x) ln q(x)/p(x)dx is the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence.
Variational representation (7) allows us to consider the
cases of whether Z is degenerated or not separately. In particular, when Z ∼ q ∗ (Z) is not degenerated, then A5 guarantees that p(X, Z | K) is regular, and standard asymptotic results such as Laplace’s method are applicable. In
contrast, if q ∗ (Z) is degenerated, p(X, Z | K) becomes
singular and its asymptotic behavior is unclear.
In this section, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the
variational representation (7) in both cases and show that
gFIC is accurate even if q ∗ (Z) is degenerated. Our main
contribution is the following theorem.2
Theorem 2. Let K 0 = κ(p(Z | X, K)). Then,
ln p(X | K) = gFIC(K 0 ) + O(1).

(8)

We emphasize that the above theorem holds even if the
model family does not include the true distribution of X.
To prove Theorem 2, we ﬁrst investigate the asymptotic behavior of ln p(X | K) for the non-degenerated case.
3.1. Non-degenerated Cases
Suppose K ∫is ﬁxed, and consider the marginalization
p(X, Z) = p(X, Z|Π)p(Π)dΠ. If p(Z|X) is not degenerated, then Z ∼ p(Z|X) is not degenerated with probability one. This sufﬁces to guarantee the regularity condition (A5) and hence to justify the application of Laplace’s
method, which approximates p(X, Z) in an asymptotic
manner (Tierney & Kadane, 1986).
Lemma 3. If Z is not degenerated, p(X, Z) =
( )DΠ /2
2π
−1/2
(1 + O(N −1 )).
p(X, Z, Π̂)|FΠ̂ |
N

constant by deﬁnition. Therefore, ignoring all of the information of FΠ̂ in Eq. (9) just gives another O(1) error
and equivalence of gFIC (8) still holds. However, FΞ contains important information of which component is effectively used to captures X. Therefore, we use the relation
>
ln |FΠ | = ln |FΞ | + ln |FΞ,Π F−1
Π FΞ,Π | and remain the
ﬁrst term in gFIC. In Section 4.3, we interpret the effect of
FΞ in more detail.
3.2. Degenerated Cases
If p(Z | X, K) is degenerated, then the regularity condition does not hold, and we cannot use Laplace’s method
(Lemma 3) directly. In that case, however, A1 guarantees the existence of a variable transformation (Z, Π) →
(Z̃K 0 , Π̃K 0 ) that replaces the joint likelihood by the equivalent yet smaller “regular” model: p(X, Z | K) =
∫
p(X, Z | Π, K)p(Π | K)dΠ
∫
= p(X, Z̃K 0 | Π̃K 0 , K 0 )p̃(Π̃K 0 | K 0 )dΠ̃K 0 . (11)
Since Z̃K 0 is not degenerated in the model K 0 , we can
apply Laplace’s method and obtain asymptotic approximation (10) by replacing K by K 0 . Note that the transformed
prior p̃(ΠK 0 | K 0 ) would differ from the original prior
p(ΠK 0 | K 0 ). However, since the prior does not depend
on N (A3), the difference is at most O(1), which is asymptotically ignorable.
Eq. (11) also gives us an asymptotic form of the marginal
posterior.
Proposition 4.
p(Z | X, K) = pK (Z)(1 + O(N −1 )),
{
p(Z,X|Π̂,K)|FΠ̂ |−1/2
K = κ(Z),
C
pK (Z) ≡
pκ(Z) (Tκ(Z) (Z))
K > κ(Z),

(12)
(13)

where TK 0 : Z → Z̃K 0 as Eq. (3) and C is the normalizing
constant.

(10)

The above proposition indicates that, if κ(p(Z | X, K)) =
K 0 , p(Z | X, K) is represented by the non-degenerated
distribution p(Z | X, K 0 ). Now, we see that the joint likelihood (11) and the marginal posterior (12) depend on K 0
rather than K. Therefore, putting these results into variational bound (7) leads to (8), i.e., ln p(X | K) is represented by gFIC of the “true” model K 0 .

Substitution of Eq. (10) into Eq. (7) yields Eq. (8).Note
that we drop the O(1) terms: ln p(Π̂) (see A3), D2Π ln 2π,
and a term related to FΘ̂ to obtain Eq. (10). We emphasize here that the magnitude of FΠ (and FΘ and FΞ ) is

Theorem 2 indicates that, if the model K is overcomplete
for the true model K 0 , ln p(X | K) takes the same value as
ln p(X | K 0 ).
Corollary 5. For every K > K 0 = κ(p(Z | X)),

(9)

This result immediately yields the following relation:
ln p(X, Z) = L(Z, Π̂, K) + O(1).

2

A formal proof is given in supplemental material.

ln p(X | K) = ln p(X | K 0 ) + O(1).

(14)

Rebuilding Factorized Information Criterion

This implication is fairly intuitive in the sense that if X
concentrates on the subspace of the model, then marginalization with respect to the parameters outside of the subspace contributes nothing to ln p(X | K). Corollary 5
also justiﬁes model selection of the LVMs on the basis
of the marginal likelihood. According to Corollary 5, at
N → ∞ redundant models always take the same value of
the marginal likelihood as that of the true model, and we
can safely exclude them from model candidates.

4. The gFAB Inference
To evaluate gFIC (2), we need to solve several estimation
problems. First, we need to estimate p(Z | X, K) to minimize the KL divergence in Eq. (6). In addition, since
ln p(X | K) depends on the true model K 0 (Theorem 2),
we need to check whether the current model is degenerated
or not, and if it is degenerated, we need to estimate K 0 .
This is paradoxical, because we would like to determine K 0
through model selection. However, by using the properties
of gFIC, we can obtain K 0 efﬁciently by optimization.

4.1.2. U PDATE OF Π
After obtaining q, we need to estimate Π̂ for each sample
Z ∼ q(Z), which is also intractable. Alternatively, we estimate the expected MJLE Π̄ = argmaxΠ Eq [ln p(X, Z |
Π)]. Since the max operator has convexity, Jensen’s inequality shows that replacing Π̂ by Π̄ introduces the following lower bound.
Eq [ln p(X, Z | Π̂)] = Eq [max ln p(X, Z | Π)]
Π

Π

By applying Laplace’s method to Eq. (11) and substituting
it into the variational form (6), we obtain ln p(X | K) =
(15)

Since the KL divergence is non-negative, substituting this
into Eq. (8) and ignoring the KL divergence gives a lower
bound of gFIC(K 0 ), i.e.,
gFIC(K 0 ) ≥ Eq [L(Z, Π̂, κ(q))] + H(q).

In some models, such as MMs (Fujimaki & Morinaga,
2012), the mean-ﬁeld approximation sufﬁces to solve the
variational problem. If it is still intractable, other approximations are necessary. For BPCA, for example,
we restrict
∏
q as the Gaussian density q(Z) =
N
(z
|µn , Σn ),
n
n
which we use in the experiments (Section 7).

≥Eq [ln p(X, Z | Π̄)] = max Eq [ln p(X, Z | Π)].

4.1. Computation of gFIC

Eq [L(Z, Π̂, κ(q))] + H(q) + KL(qkq ∗ ) + O(1).

Proposition 6. Suppose p(Z|X, K) is not degenerated in distribution. Then, p(Z|X, K) converges to
p(Z|X, Π̂, K), and p(Z|X, K) is asymptotically mutually
independent for z1 , . . . , zn .

(16)

This formulation allows us to estimate gFIC(K 0 ) via maximizing the lower bound. Moreover, we no longer need
to know K 0 —if the initial dimension of q is greater than
K 0 , the maximum of lower bound (16) attains gFIC(K 0 )
and thus ln p(X | K 0 ). Similarly to other variational inference problems, this optimization is solved by iterative
maximization of q and Π.
4.1.1. U PDATE OF q
As suggested in Eq. (15), the maximizer of lower
bound (16) is p(Z | X) in which the asymptotic form
is shown in Proposition 4. Unfortunately, we cannot use
this as q, because the normalizing constant is intractable.
One helpful
∏ tool is the mean-ﬁeld approximation of q, i.e.,
q(Z) =
n qn (zn ). Although the asymptotic marginal
posterior (12) depends on n due to FΠ , this dependency
eventually vanishes for N → ∞, and the mean-ﬁeld approximation still maintains the asymptotic consistency of
gFIC.

Since Π̄ depends only on q, we now need to compute the
parameter only once. Remarkably, Π̂ is consistent with Π̄
and the above equality holds asymptotically.
Proposition 7. If q(Z) is not degenerated in distribution,
p
then Π̂ → Π̄.
Since Eq [ln p(X, Z|Π)] is the average of the concave function (A5), Eq [ln p(X, Z|Π)] itself is also concave and
the estimation of Π̄ is relatively easy. If the expectations Eq [ln p(X, Z|Π)] and Eq [FΠ ] are analytically written, then gradient-based methods sufﬁce to obtain Π̄.
4.1.3. M ODEL P RUNING
During the optimization of q, it can become degenerated
or nearly degenerated. In such a case, by deﬁnition of objective (16), we need to change the form of L(Z, Π̂, K)
to L(Z, Π̂, K 0 ). This can be accomplished by using the
transformation (Z, Π) → (Z̃K 0 , Π̃K 0 ) and decreasing the
current model from K to K 0 , i.e., removing degenerated
components. We refer to this operation as “model pruning”. We practically verify the degeneration by the rank of
FΞ , i.e., we perform model pruning if the eigenvalues are
less than some threshold.
4.2. The gFAB Algorithm
Algorithm 1 summarizes the above procedures, solving the
following optimization problem:
max Eq [L(Z, Π̄(q), κ(q))] + H(q),

of X, then FΠ̂ converges to the Fisher information matrix.
From another viewpoint, FΠ̂ is interpreted as the covariance matrix of the asymptotic posterior of Π. As a result
of applying the Bernstein-von Mises theorem, the asymptotic normality holds for the posterior p(Π|X, Z) in which
the covariance is given by (N FΠ̂ )−1 .

The gFAB algorithm is the block coordinate ascent. Therefore, if the pruning threshold δ is sufﬁciently small, each
step monotonically increases objective (17), and the algorithm stops at a critical point.
A unique property of the gFAB algorithm is that it estimates the true model K 0 along with the updates of q and
Π̄. If N is sufﬁciently large and the initial model Kmax is
larger than K 0 , the algorithm learns pK 0 (Z) as q, according
to Proposition 4. At the same time, model pruning removes
degenerated K − K 0 components. Therefore, if the solutions converge to the global optimum, the gFAB algorithm
returns K 0 .
4.3. How FΠ Works?
Proposition 4 shows that if the model is not degenerated, objective (17) is maximized at q(Z) = pK (Z) ∝
p(Z|X, Π̂)|FΠ̂ |−1/2 , which is the product of the unmarginalized posterior p(Z|X, Π̂) and the gFIC penalty
term |FΠ̂ |−1/2 . Since |FΠ̂ |−1/2 has a peak where Z is
degenerating, it changes the shape of p(Z|X, Π̂) and increases the probability that Z is degenerated. Figure 1 illustrates how the penalty term affects the posterior.
Note that, if the model family contains the true distribution

This interpretation has the following implication. In maximizing the variational lower bound (7), we maximize
− 12 ln |FΞ |. In the gFAB algorithm, this is equivalent to
maximize the posterior covariance and pruning the components where those covariance diverge to inﬁnity. Divergence of the posterior covariance means that there is insufﬁcient information to determine those parameters, which
are not necessary for the model and thus can reasonably be
removed.

5. Relationship with VB
Similarly to FAB, VB alternatingly optimizes with respect
to Z and Π, whereas VB treats both of them as distributions. Suppose K ≤ K 0 , i.e., the case when the posterior
p(Z | X, K 0 ) is not degenerated in distribution. Then, the
marginal log-likelihood is written by the variational lower
bound. Namely, let J (Z, Π) ≡ ln p(X, Z, Π | K 0 ), and
ln p(X | K 0 ) ≥ Eq(Z,Π) [J (Z, Π)] + H(q(Z, Π))
≥Eq(Z)q(Π) [J (Z, Π)] + H(q(Z)) + H(q(Π)),

(19)

where we use the mean-ﬁeld approximation q(Z, Π) =
q(Π)q(Z). The maximizers of Eq. (19) are given as
q̃(Π) ∝ exp(Eq(Z) [J ]), q̃(Z) ∝ exp(Eq(Π) [J ]). (20)
Here, we look inside the optimal distributions to see the
relationship with the gFAB algorithm. Let us consider to
restrict the density q(Π) to be Gaussian. Since Eq(Z) [J ]
increases proportional to N while ln p(Π) does not, q̃(Π)
attains its maximum around Π̄. Then, the second order
expansion to ln q̃(Π) at Π̄ yields the solution q̃(Π) =
N (Π̄, (N FΠ̄ )−1 ). We remark that this solution can be
seen as an empirical version of the asymptotic normal
posterior given by Proposition 9. Then, if we further
approximate J (Z, Π) by the second order expansion at
Π = Π̄, the other expectation Eq(Π) [J (Z, Π)] appearing
in Eq. (20) is evaluated by J (Z, Π̄) − 12 ln |FΠ̄ |. Under
these approximations, alternating updates of {Π̄, FΠ̄ } and
q̃(Z) coincide exactly with the gFAB algorithm3 , which
justiﬁes the VB lower bound as an asymptotic expansion
of p(X | K 0 ).
Proposition 10. Let LVB (K) be the VB lower bound (19)
with restricting q(Π) to be Gaussian and approximating
3

Note that model pruning is not necessary when K ≤ K 0 .

Rebuilding Factorized Information Criterion

the expectation in ln q̃(Z) by the second order expansion.
Then, for K ≤ K 0 , ln p(X | K) = LVB (K) + O(1).
Proposition 10 states that the VB approximation is asymptotically accurate as well as gFIC when the model is
not degenerated. For the degenerated case, the asymptotic behavior of LVB (K) of general LVMs is unclear except for a few speciﬁc models such as Gaussian
MMs (Watanabe & Watanabe, 2006) and reduced rank regressions (Watanabe, 2009).
Proposition 10 also suggests that the mean-ﬁeld approximation does not loose the consistency with p(X | K). As
shown in Proposition 9, for K ≤ K 0 , the posterior covariance is given by (N FΠ̂ )−1 , which goes to 0 for N → ∞,
i.e., the posterior converges to a point. Therefore, mutual
dependence among Z and Π eventually vanishes in the posterior, and the mean-ﬁeld assumption holds asymptotically.

6. Related Work
The EM Algorithm Algorithm 1 looks quite similar to
the EM algorithm, solving
max Eq [ln p(X | Π, K)] + H(q).
q,Π

(21)

We see that both gFAB and EM algorithms iteratively update the posterior-like distribution of Z and estimate Π.
The essential difference between them is that the EM algorithm infers the posterior p(Z|X, Π̂) in the E-step, but the
gFAB algorithm infers the marginal posterior p(Z|X) '
p(Z|X, Π̂)|FΠ̂ |−1/2 . As discussed in Section 4.3, the
penalty term |FΠ̂ |−1/2 increases the probability mass of
the posterior, where Z is degenerating, enabling automatic
model determination through model pruning. In contrast,
the EM algorithm lacks such pruning mechanism, and always overﬁts to X as long as N is ﬁnite while p(Z|X)
eventually converges to p(Z|X, Π̂) for N → ∞ (see
Proposition 6).

Collapsed VB (CVB) (Teh et al., 2006) is a variation of
VB. Similarly to gFIC, CVB takes the variational bound
after marginalizing out Π from the joint likelihood. In
contrast to gFIC, CVB approximates q in a non-asymptotic
manner, such as the ﬁrst-order expansion (Asuncion et al.,
2009). Although such approximation has been found to
be accurate in practice, its asymptotic properties, such as
consistency, have not been explored. Note that as one of
those
∏ approximations, the mean-ﬁeld assumption q(Z) =
n q(zn ) is used in the original CVB paper (Teh et al.,
2006), motivated by the intuition that the dependence
among {zn } is weak after marginalization. Proposition 6
formally justiﬁes this asymptotic independence assumption
on the marginal distribution employed in CVB.
Several authors have studied about asymptotic behaviors
of VB methods for LVMs. Wang & Titterington (2004) investigated the VB approximation for linear dynamical systems and showed the inconsistency of VB estimation with
large observation noise. Watanabe & Watanabe (2006) derived an asymptotic variational lower bound of the Gaussian MMs and demonstrated its usefulness for the model selection. Recently, Nakajima et al. (2014) analyzed the VB
learning on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003), who revealed conditions for the consistency and
clariﬁed its transitional behavior of the parameter sparsity.
By comparing with these existing works, we have a contribution in terms of that our asymptotic analysis is valid for
general LVMs, rather than individual models.
BIC and Extensions Let Y = (X, Z) be a pair of nondegenerated X and Z. By ignoring all the constant terms
of Laplace’s approximation (9), we obtain BIC (Schwarz,
1978) considering Y as an observation, which is given by
the right-hand side of the following equation.
ln p(Y | K) = ln p(Y | Π̂, K) −

DΠ
ln N + O(1).
2

Note that Eq. (21) has O(ln N ) error against ln p(X).
Analogously to gFIC, this error is easily reduced to O(1)
by adding − D2Π ln N . This modiﬁcation provides another
information criterion, which we refer to as BICEM.

Unfortunately, the above relation
does not hold for p(X |
∫
K). Since p(X | K) = p(Y | K)dZ mixes up degenerated and non-degenerated cases, p(X | K) always
becomes singular. This looses the necessary condition A5
for Laplace’s approximation.

VB Methods As discussed in the previous section,
gFIC/gFAB has better theoretical properties than the VB
methods. Another key advantage is that gFIC/gFAB does
not depend on hyperparameters. The VB methods introduce a prior distribution in an explicit form and often with
hyperparameters, and we need to determine the hyperparameters by e.g., the empirical Bayes. Conversely, gFIC
ignores the direct effect of the prior as O(1) (see A3) but
takes into account the effect caused by the marginalization
via Laplace’s method. This makes gFIC prior-free and let
hyperparameter tuning unnecessary.

There are several studies that extend BIC to be able to
deal with singular models. Watanabe (2009) evaluates
p(X | K) with an O(1) error for any singular models by
using algebraic geometry. However, it requires an evaluation of the intractable rational number called the real log
canonical threshold. Recent study (Watanabe, 2013) relaxes this intractable evaluation to the evaluation
of crite√
rion called WBIC at the expense of an Op ( ln N ) error.
Yet, the evaluation of WBIC needs an expectation with respect to a practically intractable distribution, which usually
incurs heavy computation.

Figure 2 depicts the objective functions after convergence
for K = 2, . . . , 30. Note that, we performed gFAB with
K = 30 and it ﬁnally converged at K ' 10 owing to
model pruning, which allowed us to skip the computation
for K ' 10, . . . , 30, and the objective values for those Ks
are not drawn in the ﬁgure. We see that gFAB successfully chose the true model, except for the small sample
size (N = 100) where gFAB underestimated the model.
In contrast, the objective of EM slightly but monotonically increased with K, which means EM always chose the
largest K as the best model. This is because EM maximizes
Eq. (21), which does not contain the model complexity
term of Π. As our analysis suggested in Section 6, BICEM
and VB1 are close to gFAB as N increasing and has a peak
around K 0 = 10, meaning that BICEM and VB1 are adequate for model selection. However, in contrast to gFAB,
both of them need to compute for all K. Interestingly, VB2
were unstable for N < 2000 and it gave the inconsistent
model selection results. We observed that VB2 had very
strong dependence on the initial values. This behavior is
understandable because VB2 has the additional prior and
hyperparameters to be estimated, which might produce additional local minima that make optimization difﬁcult.

We compare the performance of model selection for BPCA
explained in Section 2.1 with the EM algorithm, BICEM introduced in Section 6, simple VB (VB1), full VB (VB2),
and the gFAB algorithm. VB2 had the priors for W, λ,
and α described in Section 2.1 in which the hyperparameters were ﬁxed as aλ = bλ = aα = bα = 0.01 by following (Bishop, 1999). VB1 is a simple variant of VB2,
which ﬁxed α = 1. In this experiments, We used the synthetic data X = ZW> + E where W ∼ uniform([0, 1])4 ,
Z ∼ N (0, I), and End ∼ N (0, σ 2 ). Under the data dimensionality D = 30 and the true model K 0 = 10, we
generated data with N = 100, 500, 1000, and 2000. We
stopped the algorithms if the relative error was less than
10−5 or the number of iterations was greater than 104 .

8. Conclusion
This paper provided an asymptotic analysis for the
marginal log-likelihood of LVMs. As the main contribution, we proposed gFIC for model selection and showed its
consistency with the marginal log-likelihood. Part of our
analysis also provided insight into the EM and VB methods. Numerical experiments conﬁrmed the validity of our
analysis.
We remark that gFIC is potentially applicable to many
other LVMs, including factor analysis, LDA, canonical correlation analysis, and partial membership models. Investigating the behavior of gFIC on these models is an important
future research direction.
