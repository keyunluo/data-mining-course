Abstract
We consider the problem of undiscounted reinforcement learning in continuous state space. Regret bounds in this setting usually hold under
various assumptions on the structure of the reward and transition function. Under the assumption that the rewards and transition probabilities
are Lipschitz, for 1-dimensional state space a re3
gret bound of Õ(T 4 ) after any T steps has been
given by Ortner and Ryabko (2012). Here we
improve upon this result by using non-parametric
kernel density estimation for estimating the transition probability distributions, and obtain regret
bounds that depend on the smoothness of the
transition probability distributions. In particular,
under the assumption that the transition probability functions are smoothly differentiable, the re2
gret bound is shown to be Õ(T 3 ) asymptotically
for reinforcement learning in 1-dimensional state
space. Finally, we also derive improved regret
bounds for higher dimensional state space.

1. Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous domains is still
a big challenge, from the practical as well as from the theoretical point of view. The setting theoretically best understood is the continuous multi-armed bandit problem. Under
Hölder conditions on the reward function, regret bounds
have been given by Kleinberg (2005), Auer et al. (2007),
Kleinberg et al. (2008), and Bubeck et al. (2010).

In more general RL settings, often strong assumptions on
the transition structure are made. Thus, there are theoretical
results for RL with deterministic transitions in the discounted setting (Bernstein and Shimkin, 2010), as well as
for RL with transition functions that are linear in state and
action (Strehl and Littman, 2008; Brunskill et al., 2009;
Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvári, 2011; Ibrahmi et al.,
2012). More generally, the work of Kakade et al. (2003)
considers PAC-learning for continuous RL in metric
state spaces.
Recently, Osband and Van Roy (2014)
have derived bounds on the expected regret under the
assumption that the reward and the transition probability
function belong to a given class of functions. The bounds
then depend on particular parameters of these function
classes, called the Kolmogorov dimension and the eluder
dimension. Unlike that, here we try to assume the most
general setting making only smoothness assumptions on
rewards and transition probabilities.
Our research is based on the work of Ortner and Ryabko
(2012), which has given the most general regret bounds in
a continuous state RL setting so far. Under the assumption that reward and transition functions are Hölder continuous, sublinear regret bounds depending on the Hölder
parameters have been shown. The suggested algorithm discretizes the state space and employs the UCRL algorithm
of Jaksch et al. (2010) on the discretized MDP. We improve
upon this algorithm and the respective regret bound by using kernel density estimation instead of histograms for estimating the probability density functions. Kernel-based
methods have been employed in RL before, starting with
(Ormoneit and Sen, 2002). Here we provide the first regret
bounds for a kernel-based algorithm for RL in continuous
state space. In order to derive our regret bounds we need
concentration bounds for the employed kernel density estimator. Such bounds can be found e.g. in (Devroye, 1987).
However, for our particular case, we extend results of

Improved Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous RL

Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1981) and Vogel and Schettler
(2013) to the case where the samples are assumed to be
only independent but not necessarily i.i.d.
The regret bounds we obtain improve over known bounds
for the UCCRL algorithm (Ortner and Ryabko, 2012), provided that the transition probability functions are sufficiently smooth. While the UCCRL algorithm gives
2+α
Õ(T 2+2α ) regret for MDPs with 1-dimensional state space
and Hölder-continuous rewards and transition probabilities with parameter α, the proposed UCCRL-KD algorithm
β+αβ+2α
has regret of order Õ(T β+2αβ+2α ), where the transition
function is assumed to be κ-times smoothly differentiable
and β := κ + α. Thus, we obtain improved bounds if
α < κ. For the simple case of Lipschitz continuous den3
sities, i.e. α = 1, the regret is Õ(T 4 ) for UCCRL, while
2
for UCCRL-KD it asymptotically approaches Õ(T 3 ), provided that the transition probability functions are infinitely
often smoothly differentiable. For general d-dimensional
state space we show that the regret for UCCRL-KD is
1+dα+α
2d+α
Õ(T 1+dα+2α ), improving over the bound of Õ(T 2d+2α ) for
UCCRL.

2. Setting
For the sake of simplicity, we concentrate on the 1dimensional case. Details for the general d-dimensional
setting are given in Section 4.1 below. Thus, consider a
Markov decision process (MDP) with state space [0, 1] and
finite action space of size A. We assume that the random
reward in any state s under any action a is bounded in [0, 1]
with mean r(s, a). The transition probability distribution at
state s under action a is denoted by p(·|s, a). We make the
following assumptions on the reward and transition probability functions.
Assumption 1. There are L, α > 0 such that for any two
states s, s′ and all actions a,


r(s, a) − r(s′ , a) ≤ L|s − s′ |α .
Assumption 2. There are L, α > 0 such that for any two
states s, s′ and all actions a,


p(·|s, a) − p(·|s′ , a) ≤ L|s − s′ |α .
1

These two assumptions are the same as in
(Ortner and Ryabko, 2012).
They guarantee that rewards and transition probabilities are close in close states,
but do not make any assumption on the shape of the
transition probability densities. Here, we additionally
assume that the transition functions are smooth, which
allows us to obtain improved regret bounds.
Assumption 3. The transition functions p(·|s, a) are κtimes smoothly differentiable for all states s and all actions a. That is, there are L, α > 0 such that for any

state s and all actions a,
 (κ) ′

p (s |s, a) − p(κ) (s′′ |s, a) ≤ L|s′ − s′′ |α .
For the sake of simplicity, in the following we assume that
L and α ≤ 1 in Assumptions 1–3 are the same. Note that
for α > 1 the transition functions would be constant and
learning hence trivial.
We assume (for the following assumptions and technical
details see Section 2 of Ortner and Ryabko, 2012) the existence of an optimal policy π ∗ with optimal average reward ρ∗ independent of the initial state. Further, we assume
that for each measurable policy π the Poisson equation1
∫
ρπ + λ(π, s) = r(s, π(s)) + p(ds′ |s, π(s)) λ(π, s′ )
holds, where ρπ is the average reward of π and λ(π, s)
is the bias of policy π in state s.
Note that for
any policy π the Poisson equation is satisfied under
modest assumptions such as geometric convergence to
an invariant probability measure µπ , cf. Chapter 10 of
(Hernández-Lerma and Lasserre, 1999).
We recall from (Ortner and Ryabko, 2012) that under Assumptions 1 and 2 the bias of the optimal policy is bounded.
The performance of an algorithm is measured by the regret
it receives after T time steps, defined as
∆T = T ρ∗ −

T
∑

rt ,

t=1

where rt is the (random) reward obtained by the algorithm at time step t. Note that (cf. Chapter 10 of
Hernández-Lerma and Lasserre, 1999) no policy can obtain higher accumulated reward than T ρ∗ + H after any
T steps, where
H := sup λ(π ∗ , s) − inf λ(π ∗ , s)
s

s

is the bias span of the optimal policy.

3. Algorithm
As already indicated, our algorithm is based on the UCCRL
algorithm of Ortner and Ryabko (2012). In the UCCRL algorithm, in the first step the state space [0, 1] is discretized
into n intervals Ij of equal size. Thus, the estimates for
rewards and transition probabilities are aggregated correspondingly, that is, states contained in the same interval Ij
are clubbed together and considered as coming from a single (discrete) state. This gives a discrete-state MDP, to
1
In the following, we usually skip the range of integration
when it is clear from context.

Improved Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous RL

which the UCRL algorithm of (Jaksch et al., 2010) can be
applied. The algorithm UCCRL-KD that we propose uses
the same aggregation technique for the rewards. However,
concerning the estimated transition probability functions,
we only aggregate inasmuch as states contained in the same
interval Ij will obtain the same estimated transition function and that for computing this estimate we use all samples of states in the same interval. The estimation of this
function will be done by a kernel density estimate, that is,
without using any kind of discretization.
For the sake of completeness, our UCCRL-KD algorithm
is depicted as Algorithm 1. Proceeding in episodes k =
1, 2, . . . in which the chosen policy π̃k remains the same, in
each episode k a set of plausible MDPs Mk , determined by
confidence intervals for rewards and transition probabilities, is considered (cf. line 7 of the algorithm). From this set
the algorithm chooses the (so-called optimistic) MDP M̃k
whose optimal policy π̃k promises the highest possible average reward ρ∗ (M̃k ) (line 8). This policy is then employed
in episode k, which is terminated if some action in some interval Ij has been played as often in the episode as before
the episode (line 10), so that recomputation of estimates
and policy is justified.
Basically, UCCRL-KD looks the same as UCCRL, only
that the estimates and confidence intervals for the transition probabilities are different. For these we do not use a
histogram based estimator as for UCCRL, but (results for)
a kernel density estimator. The confidence intervals employed in line 7 of the algorithm are given by
√
7 log(2nAt/δ)
−α
conf r (s, a, n, A, δ, t) := Ln +

2Nt (I(s), a)

(√
(
))
−β
Nt (I(s), a) 2β+2 C1′ log 14 log 2nAt
. (2)
δ
Here Nt (Ij , a) is the maximum of 1 and the number of
times action a has been played in a state contained in interval Ij at step t. Further, I(s) denotes the interval Ij
that contains the state s. The constants C0 and C1′ :=
3
C1 L + C2 + C
2π depend on the employed kernel density
estimator, cf. Assumption 4 and Section 5.2.3 below. Finally, β := κ + α depends on the smoothness of the transition functions. The confidence intervals for the transition
probabilities come from the tail bounds that we derive in
Section 5.1. In the following, we describe the kernel density estimator in detail.

In general, given i.i.d. samples X1 , . . . , XN from a

While the estimates r̂(s, a) for the mean rewards are computed as for UCCRL (that is, one takes the average of the
rewards observed in all states in I(s)), for the estimates
p̂(·|s, a) we use a suitable kernel density estimator.

and h is the bandwidth of the estimator.
In our case we want to estimate the transition probability
distribution in each state s. Since in general it may be the

Improved Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous RL

case that we visit a state s not more than once (or not at
all), we compute the estimate p̂(·|s, a) using all samples
from states that are contained in I(s), the interval Ij containing s. Note that therefore our samples will in general
only be independent but not i.i.d. Still, we will show in
Theorem 1 below that due to Assumptions 2 and 3 on the
probability distributions the density estimator in (3) will
give a sufficiently good estimation.
Assumptions on the kernel To guarantee that our confidence intervals for the estimated transition functions
p̂(·|s, a) hold with high probability (cf. Theorem 1 below),
additionally to (4) we need the following assumptions on
the employed kernel function K.
Assumption 4. Let κ be the smoothness parameter defined
in Assumption 3. Then the kernel function K satisfies

Theorem 1. Let f := p(·|s, a) be a transition probability distribution satisfying Assumptions 2 and 3, and
let fˆN be a kernel density estimate of f for which Assumption 4 holds and which is computed from samples X1 , . . . , Xn of the transition probability distributions
f1 := p(·|s1 , a), . . . , fN := p(·|sN , a) in states s1 , . . . , sN

Theorem 1 allows us to derive the following regret bound.
Theorem 2. Consider an MDP with state space [0, 1],
A actions, rewards and transition probabilities satisfying
Assumptions 1–3, and bias span (upper bounded by) H.
Then with probability 1 − δ, the regret of UCCRL-KD (with
input parameters n ≤ T and δ) after T steps is upper
bounded by

Setting n = T β+2αβ+2α gives an upper bound of

Thus, we have to use a kernel that depends on the smoothness of the transition probabilities. While kernels of infinite order and compact support do not exist (see p.101 of
Devroye, 1987), there are ways to generate higher order
kernels from lower order kernels (Abdous, 1995), which
guarantees that for each κ there is a suitable kernel available. In particular, polynomial kernels of arbitrary finite order and compact support exist (Gasser et al., 1985), which
by definition satisfy equation (5). It can be easily verified
that polynomial kernels with compact support also satisfy
equations (6)–(9).

4. Results
In order to establish our improved bounds on the regret,
we need high probability bounds for the new confidence
intervals (1) and (2). Note that, for the densities p(·|s, a)
we are interested in, the observed transitions in general are
from different states in I(s) with close but different densities. Thus, these observations are in general not i.i.d., but
only independent. Still, the following tail bound for the respective kernel density estimator fˆN computed from these
independent observations can be established.

Equation (10) gives a bound on the regret that resembles
that for UCCRL: The second term corresponds to the discretization error (and is the same as for UCCRL), while the
first term corresponds to the error in the discrete MDP (and
is improved compared to the respective regret of UCCRL).

Remark 1. Compared to the regret bound of Õ(HL A ·
2+α
T 2+2α ) for UCCRL (Ortner and Ryabko, 2012), the bound
for UCCRL-KD has improved dependence on T for all α
as soon as κ > α. For the Lipschitz case α = 1 the bound
2
for UCCRL-KD approaches Õ(T 3 ) when κ → ∞, while
3
the respective bound for UCCRL is Õ(T 4 ).
Remark 2. As for the UCCRL algorithm, if the horizon T
is unknown then the doubling trick can be used to give the
same bound with slightly worse constants.
4.1. d-dimensional State Space
Under the following additional assumptions UCCRL-KD
(with modified confidence intervals) gives also improved
regret bounds in MDPs with state space of dimension d.

d = 1 than Theorem 4.

In the following, we give detailed proofs only of Theorems 1 and 2. The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to that of
Theorem 1, only that Lemma 1 is replaced by an analogue
based on the Lemma on p.7 of Vogel and Schettler (2013).
Theorem 4 is then shown as Theorem 2 with Theorem 1
replaced by Theorem 3.

This latter argument is similar to the one in Theorem 4.1 of
Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1981). Combining (12), (13),
and (15) proves the lemma.

as shown in the Lemma on p.6 of Vogel and Schettler
(2013). It is straightforward to check that the given proof
works also for independent samples and actually does not
make use of the i.i.d. assumption. For the first term of (17)
we can use Lemma 1, so that we obtain

The second term of (16) can be bounded as in Theorem 1

sufficient to obtain

5.2. Proof of Theorem 2
The proof structure follows that of Ortner and Ryabko
(2012) so that we can take some equations directly from
there. However, some arguments have to be changed and
adapted.
5.2.1. A L EMMA
The main regret term in the discretized MDP comes from a
sum over all confidence intervals in the visited state-action
pairs. In order to bound this term we use the following
lemma. This lemma is a generalization of Lemma 19 of
Jaksch et al. (2010), which showed the result for the case
α = 12 .
Lemma 2. For any sequence of positive

and any α ∈ [0, 1],

Znα
1−α ≤ 2α − 1 .
Z
k=1 k−1

Proof. For n = 1 the lemma is easy to verify. Proceeding
by induction on n, note that for x ∈ [0, 1] and α ∈ [0, 1]
it holds that 1 + (2α − 1)x ≤ (1 + x)α . Thus, choosing

5.2.2. S PLITTING INTO E PISODES
Let vk (s, a) be the number of times action a has been chosen in episode k when being in state s. Define the regret in
episode k to be
∑
(

vk (s, a) ρ∗ − r(s, a) .
(21)
∆k :=
s,a

Then, as in Section 5.1 of Ortner and Ryabko (2012) (cf.
also Section 4.1 of Jaksch et al., 2010), with probability at
least 1− 12Tδ5/4 the regret of UCCRL-KD is upper bounded
by

5.2.3. FAILING C ONFIDENCE I NTERVALS
We continue by considering the regret when the true MDP
is not contained in the set of plausible MDPs.

Improved Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous RL

Rewards For the rewards we have the same Assumption 1 as Ortner and Ryabko (2012), so this case can be
handled in the same way. Thus, the estimated rewards
r̂(s, a) are computed from the observed rewards in states
si that are in the same interval as state s. Assume that at
step t there have been N > 0 samples of action a in such
states. Then we obtain as in (Ortner and Ryabko, 2012)
from Hoeffding inequality that
}

7
≤
Pr r̂(s, a) − E[r̂(s, a)] ≥ 2N log δ
.
60nAt7
∑N
Further, we have E[r̂(s, a)] = N1 i=1 r(si , a). Since the
si are assumed to be in the same interval I(s) as s, it follows that |E[r̂(s, a)] − r(s, a)| < Ln−α .

Regret when Confidence Intervals Fail In (23) and (24)
we have shown that the confidence intervals conf r and
conf p for rewards and transition probabilities as given in
δ
(1) and (2) hold with error probability 15t
6 each. These
error probabilities are the same as in (Ortner and Ryabko,
2012). Therefore, we obtain (cf. also Section 4.2 of
Jaksch et al., 2010) the same regret bound for the case
when the true MDP is not contained in the set of plausible MDPs, that is, with probability at least 1 − 12Tδ5/4 ,

A union bound over all actions, all n intervals Ij and all t
possible values of N then shows that with probability at
δ
least 1 − 15t
6 it holds that
√


−α
r̂(s, a) − r(s, a) < Ln + 7 log(2nAt/δ) . (23)
2Nt (I(s), a)

Now let us finally turn to the regret in episodes where
the true MDP M is contained in the set of plausible
MDPs Mk . Note that in this case by the optimistic choice
of π̃k it holds that ρ̃∗k := ρ∗ (M̃k ) ≥ ρ∗ . Therefore,

Transition Probabilities Now for the estimates of the
transition probabilities we apply Theorem 1 to obtain confidence intervals that hold with high probability. At step t,
for each state s in which we want to estimate p(·|s, a) the
samples will only come from nearby states s1 , . . . , sN that
are in the interval I(s) also containing s. Thus, the samples
will be independent and, according to Assumption 2, from
close (but not necessarily identical) distributions.

and we can bound the regret ∆k of episode k as defined
in (21) by (23) and the definition (1) of the confidence intervals conf r as

term s vk (s, π̃k (s)) ρ̃∗k − r̃k (s, π̃k (s)) can be analysed
similar to Section 5.4 of Ortner and Ryabko (2012). That
is, let λ̃k := λ(π̃k , ·) be the bias function of policy π̃k in
the optimistic MDP M̃k . Then by the Poisson equation,
ρ̃∗k − r̃k (s, π̃k (s))

6. Open Questions
The main missing link is respective lower bounds. Some
preliminary bounds have been given by Ortner and Ryabko
(2012), but they appear to be not optimal. On the other
hand, the construction of lower bounds in our setting (taking into account the assumptions on the transition probabilities) seems not easy. In general, we believe that getting
improved lower bounds in the continuous state setting is
closely related to the still open problem of closing the gap
between known upper and lower bound for the regret in finite state MDPs, cf. (Jaksch et al., 2010).
Concerning computational issues, already for UCCRL it
is not clear whether there is an efficient method to compute the optimistic plausible MDP and the respective optimal policy in line 8 of the algorithm. This issue has not
been resolved for UCCRL-KD and remains an open question. Also, the necessary input of an upper bound on the
bias deteriorates the bounds (by a big additive constant) for
UCCRL-KD just like for UCCRL when this bound has to
be guessed.
With respect to the need of knowledge of the smoothness
parameters, as suggested by Ortner and Ryabko (2012),
one can use the model-selection technique introduced in
(Maillard et al., 2012) and refined by Maillard et al. (2013)
to obtain regret bounds also without explicit knowledge of
κ, L, and α. However, these bounds have worse dependence on T . Still, as our bounds are an improvement over
the bounds of Ortner and Ryabko (2012), we expect to get
an improvement in this case as well. However, the respective technical details still have to be worked out.
