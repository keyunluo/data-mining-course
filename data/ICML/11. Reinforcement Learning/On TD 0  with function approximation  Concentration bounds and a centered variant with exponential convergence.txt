Abstract
We provide non-asymptotic bounds for the
well-known temporal difference learning algorithm TD(0) with linear function approximators.
These include high-probability bounds as well
as bounds in expectation. Our analysis suggests
that a step-size inversely proportional to the number of iterations cannot guarantee optimal rate of
convergence unless we assume (partial) knowledge of the stationary distribution for the Markov
chain underlying the policy considered. We also
provide bounds for the iterate averaged TD(0)
variant, which gets rid of the step-size dependency while exhibiting the optimal rate of convergence. Furthermore, we propose a variant of
TD(0) with linear approximators that incorporates a centering sequence, and establish that it
exhibits an exponential rate of convergence in expectation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
bounds on two synthetic experimental settings.

1. Introduction
Many stochastic control problems can be cast within the
framework of Markov decision processes (MDP). Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach to solve
MDPs, when the underlying transition mechanism is unknown. An important problem in RL is to estimate the
value function V π for a given stationary policy π. We focus
on discounted reward MDPs with a high-dimensional state
space S. In this setting, one can only hope to estimate the
value function approximately and this constitutes the policy evaluation step in several approximate policy iteration
methods, e.g. actor-critic algorithms (Konda & Tsitsiklis,
2003), (Bhatnagar et al., 2009).

Temporal difference learning is a well-known policy
evaluation algorithm that is both online and works with a
single sample path obtained by simulating the underlying
MDP. However, the classic TD(0) algorithm uses full-state
representations (i.e. it stores an entry for each state s ∈ S)
and hence, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. A
standard trick to alleviate this problem is to approximate
the value function within a linearly parameterized space of
functions, i.e., V π (s) ≈ θT φ(s). Here θ is a tunable parameter and φ(s) is a column feature vector with dimension d << |S|. This approximation allows for efficient
implementation of TD(0) even on large state spaces.
The update rule for TD(0) that incorporates linear function
approximators is as follows: Starting with an arbitrary θ0 ,
θn+1 = θn + γn r(sn , π(sn )) + βθnT φ(sn+1 )
(1)

T
−θn φ(sn ) φ(sn ).
In the above, the quantities γn are step sizes, chosen in
advance ,and satisfying standard stochastic approximation
conditions (see assumption (A5)). Further, r(s, a) is the reward recieved in state s on choosing action a, β ∈ (0, 1) is
a discount factor, and sn is the state of the MDP at time n.
Asymptotic convergence of TD(0). In (Tsitsiklis &
Van Roy, 1997), the authors establish that θn governed by
(1) converges almost surely to the fixed point, θ∗ , of the
projected Bellman equation given by
Φθ∗ = ΠT π (Φθ∗ ).

(2)

In the above, T π is the Bellman operator, Π is the orthogonal projection onto the linearly parameterized space
within which we approximate the value function, and Φ is
the feature matrix with rows φ(s)T , ∀s ∈ S denoting the
features corresponding to state s ∈ S (see Section 2 for
more details). Let P denote the transition probability matrix with components p(s, π(s), s0 ) that denote the probability of transitioning from state s to s0 under the action

π(s). Let r be a vector with components r(s, π(s)), and Ψ
be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal forms the stationary
distribution (assuming it exists) of the Markov chain for the
underlying policy π. Then, θ∗ can be written as the solution to the following system of equations (see Section 6.3
of (Bertsekas, 2011))
Aθ∗ = b, where A = ΦT Ψ(I − βP )Φ and b = ΦT Ψr. (3)
Our work. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on
kθn − θ∗ k2 , both in high-probability and in expectation, to
quantify the rate of convergence of TD(0) with linear function approximators. To the best of our knowledge, there
are no non-asymptotic bounds for TD(0) with function approximation, while there are asymptotic convergence and
rate results available.
Finite time analysis is challenging because:
(1) The asymptotic limit θ∗ is the fixed point of the Bellman operator, which assumes that the underlying MDP is
begun from the stationary distribution Ψ (whose influence
is evident in (3)). However, the samples provided to the
algorithm come from simulations of the MDP that are not
begun from Ψ. This is a problem for a finite time analysis, since we do not know exactly the number of steps
after which mixing of the underlying Markov chain has occurred, and the distribution of the samples that TD(0) sees
has become the stationary distribution. Moreover, an assumption on this mixing rate amounts to assuming (partial)
knowledge of the transition dynamics of the Markov chain
underlying the policy π.
(2) Standard results from stochastic approximation theory
suggest that in order to obtain the optimal rate of convergence for a step size choice of γn = c/(c + n), one has
to chose the constant c carefully. In the case of TD(0), we
derive this condition and point out the optimal choice for
c requires knowledge of the mixing rate of the underlying
Markov chain for policy π.
We handle the first problem by establishing that under
a mixing assumption (the same as that used to establish asymptotic convergence for TD(0) in (Tsitsiklis &
Van Roy, 1997)), the mixing error can be handled in the
non-asymptotic bound. This assumption is broad enough
to encompass a reasonable range of MDP problems. We
alleviate the second problem by using iterate averaging.
Variance reduction. One inherent problem with iterative
schemes that use a single sample to update the iterate at
each time step, is that of variance. This is the reason why
it is necessary to carefully choose the step-size sequence:
too large and the variance will force divergence; too small
and the algorithm will converge, but not to the solution intended. Indeed, iterate averaging is a technique that aims to
allow for larger step-sizes, while producing the same overall rate of convergence (and we show that it succeeds in

eliminating the necessity to know properties of the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain). A more
direct approach is to center the updates, and this was pioneered recently for solving batch problems via stochastic
gradient descent in convex optimization (Johnson & Zhang,
2013). We propose a variant of TD(0) that uses this approach, though our setting is considerably more complicated as samples arrive online and the function being optimized is not accessible directly.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
(1) Concentration bounds. Under assumptions similar to
(Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997), we provide non-asymptotic
bounds, both in high probability as well as in expectation
and these quantify the convergence rate of TD(0) with function approximation.
(2) Centered TD. We propose a variant of TD(0) that incorporates a centering sequence and we show that it converges
faster than the regular TD(0) algorithm in expectation.
The key insights from our finite-time analysis are:
c0 c
, with c0 < µ(1 − β)/(2(1 + β)2 )
(1) Choosing γn = (c+n)
and c such that µ(1 − β)c0 c > 1, we √
obtain the optimal
rate of convergence of the order O (1/ n), both in highprobability as well as in expectation. Here µ is the smallest
eigenvalue of the matrix ΦT ΨΦ (see Theorem 1). However, obtaining this rate is problematic as it implies (partial)
knowledge (via µ) of the transition dynamics of the MDP.
(2) With iterate averaging, one can get rid of the stepsize dependency and still obtain the optimal rate of convergence, both in high probability as well as in expectation
(see Theorem 2).
(3) For the centered variant of TD(0), we obtain an exponential convergence rate when the underlying Markov
chain mixes fast (see Theorem 3).
(4) We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds on two simple
synthetic experimental setups. In particular, using the stepsizes suggested by our bounds in Theorems 1–3, we are
able to establish convergence empirically for TD(0), and
both its averaging, as well as centered variants.
Related work. Concentration bounds for general
stochastic approximation schemes have been derived in
(Frikha & Menozzi, 2012) and later expanded to include
iterate averaging in (Fathi & Frikha, 2013). Unlike the
aforementioned reference, deriving convergence rate
results for TD(0), especially of non-asymptotic nature, requires sophisticated machinery as it involves Markov noise
that impacts the mixing rate of the underlying Markov
chain. An asymptotic normality result for TD(λ) is
available in (Konda, 2002). The authors establish there that
TD(λ) converges asymptotically to a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that depends on
A (see (3)). This rate result holds true for TD(λ) when

Concentration bounds for TD(0) with function approximation

combined with iterate averaging, while the non-averaged
case does not result in the optimal rate of convergence. Our
results are consistent with this observation, as we establish
from a finite time analysis that the non-averaged TD(0) can
result in optimal convergence only if the step-size constant
c in γn = c/(c + n) is set carefully (as a function of a
certain quantity that depends on the stationary distribution
- see (A3) below), while one can get rid of this dependency
and still obtain the optimal rate with iterate averaging.
Least squares temporal difference methods are popular
alternatives to the classic TD(λ). Asymptotic convergence
rate results for LSTD(λ) and LSPE(λ), two popular least
squares methods, are available in (Konda, 2002) and (Yu
& Bertsekas, 2009), respectively. However, to the best
of our knowledge, there are no concentration bounds that
quantify the rate of convergence through a finite time
analysis. A related work in this direction is the finite time
bounds for LSTD in (Lazaric et al., 2010). However, the
analysis there is under a fast mixing rate assumption, while
we provide non-asymptotic rate results without making
any such assumption. We note here that assuming a mixing
rate implies partial knowledge of the transition dynamics
of the MDP under a stationary policy and in typical RL
settings, this information is not available.

2. TD(0) with Linear Approximation
We consider an MDP with state space S and action space
A. The aim is to estimate the value function V π for any
given stationary policy π : S → A, where
"∞
#
X
V π (s) := E
β t r(st , π(st )) | s0 = s .
(4)
t=0

Recall that β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor, st denotes the
state of the MDP at time t, and r(s, a) denotes the reward
obtained in state s under action a. The expectation in (4) is
taken with respect to the transition dynamics P . It is wellknown that V π is the solution to the fixed point relation
V = T π (V ), where the Bellman operator T π is defined as
X
T π (V )(s) := r(s, π(s)) + β
p(s, π(s), s0 )V (s0 ), (5)
s0

TD(0) (Sutton & Barto, 1998) performs a fixed pointiteration using stochastic approximation: Starting with an
arbitrary V0 , update
Vn (sn ) := Vn−1 (sn ) + γn r(sn , π(sn ))

+ βVn−1 (sn+1 ) − Vn−1 (sn ) , (6)
where γn are step-sizes that satisfy standard stochastic approximation conditions.
As discussed in the introduction, while TD(0) algorithm is
simple and provably convergent to the fixed point of T π

for any policy, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality
associated with high-dimensional state spaces, and popular method to allieviate this is to parameterize the value
function using a linear function approximator, i.e. for every s ∈ S, approximate V π (s) ≈ φ(s)T θ. Here φ(s) is
a d-dimensional feature vector with d << |S|, and θ is a
tunable parameter. Incorporating function approximation,
an update rule for TD(0) analogous to (6) is given in (1).

3.1. Assumptions
(A1) Ergodicity: The Markov chain induced by the policy
π is irreducible and aperiodic. Moreover, there exists a stationary distribution Ψ(= Ψπ ) for this Markov chain. Let
EΨ denote the expectation w.r.t. this distribution.
(A2) Bounded rewards: |r(s, π(s))| ≤ 1, for all s ∈ S.
(A3) Linear independence: The feature matrix Φ has full
column rank. This assumption implies that the matrix
ΦT ΨΦ has smallest eigenvalue µ > 0.
(A4) Bounded features: kφ(s)k
s ∈ S.
P 2 ≤ 1, for allP
(A5) The step sizes satisfy n γn = ∞, and n γn2 < ∞.
(A6) Combined step size and mixing assumption: There
exists a non-negative function B 0 (·) such that: For all
s ∈ S and m ≥ 0,

(A6’) Uniform mixing bound: (A6) holds, and there exists
a constant B 0 that is an uniformly bound on B(s), ∀s ∈ S.
In comparison to the assumptions in (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy,
1997), (A1), (A3), (A5) have exact counterparts in (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997), while (A2), (A4) and (A6) are
simplified versions of the corresponding boundedness assumptions in (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997).
Remark 1. (Geometric ergodicity) A Markov chain is mixing at a geometric rate if
P (st = s | s0 ) − ψ(s)| ≤ Cρt .

Remark 2. K1 (n) and K2 (n) above are O(1), i.e., they
can be upper bounded by a constant. Thus, one can indeed

get the optimal rate of convergence of the order O (1/ n)
c
. However, this rate is continwith a step-size γn = (c+n)
gent upon on the constant c in the step-size being chosen
correctly. This is problematic because the right choice of
c requires the knowledge of eigenvalue µ for expectation
bound and and knowing µ would imply knowledge about
the transition probability matrix of the underlying Markov
chain. The latter information is unavailable in a typical
RL setting. The next section derives bounds for the iterate
averaged variant that overcomes this problematic step-size
dependency.
3.3. Iterate Averaging
The idea here is to employ larger step-sizes and combine it
with averaging of the iterates, i.e., θ̄n+1 := (θ1 + . . . +
θn )/n. This principle was introduced independently by
Ruppert (Ruppert, 1991) and Polyak (Polyak & Juditsky,
1992), for accelerating stochastic approximation schemes.
The following theorem establishes that iterate averaging results in the optimal rate of convergence without any stepsize dependency:

Remark 3. The step-size exponent α can be chosen arbitrarily close
√ to 1, resulting in a convergence rate of the order O (1/ n). However although the constants K1IA (n)
and K2IA (n) remain O(1), there is a minor tradeoff here
since a choice of α close to 1 would result in their bounding constants blowing up. One cannot choose c too large
or too small for the same reasons.

4. TD(0) with Centering (CTD)
CTD is a control variate solution to reduce the variance of
the updates of normal TD(0). This is achieved by adding a
zero-mean, centering term to the TD(0) update.
Let Xn = (sn , sn+1 ). Then, the TD(0) algorithm can be
seen to perform the following fixed-point iteration:
θn = θn−1 + γn fXn (θn ).

(8)

where fXn (θ) := (r(sn , π(sn )) + βθT φ(sn+1 ) −
θT φ(sn ))φ(sn ). The limit of (8) is the solution, θ∗ , of
F (θ) = 0, where F (θ) := ΠT π (Φθ) − Φθ. The idea
behind the CTD algorithm is to reduce the variance of the
increments fXn (θn ), in order that larger step sizes can be
used. This is achieved by choosing an extra iterate θ̄n , centred over the previous θn , and using an increment approximating fXn (θn ) − fXn (θ̄n ) + F (θ̄n ). The intuitive motivation for this choice is that when the CTD algorithm arrives
close to θ∗ , the centering term alone ensures the updates
become small, while with regular TD(0), one has to rely on
a decaying step size to keep the iterates close to θ∗ .
The approach is inspired by the SVRG algorithm, proposed
in (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), for a optimising a stronglyconvex function. However, the setting for TD(0) with function approximation that we have is considerably more complicated owing to the following reasons:
(i) Unlike (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), we are not optimising a function that is a finite-sum of smooth functions in a
batch setting. Instead, we are estimating a value function

which is an infinite (discounted) sum, with the individual
functions making up the sum being made available in an
online fashion (i.e. as new samples are generated from the
simulation of the underlying MDP for policy π).
(ii) The centering term in SVRG directly uses F (·), which
in our case is a limit function that is neither directly accessible nor can be simulated for any given θ.
(iii) Obtaining the exponential convergence rate is also difficult owing to the fact that TD(0) does not initially see
samples from the stationary distribution and there is an underlying mixing term that affects the rate.
(iv) Finally, there are extra difficulties owing to the fact that
we have a fixed point iteration, while the corresponding algorithm in (Johnson & Zhang, 2013) is stochastic gradient
descent (SGD).
The CTD algorithm that we propose overcomes the difficulties mentioned above and the overall scheme of this
epoch-based algorithm is presented in Figure 1. At the start
of the mth epoch, a random iterate is picked from the previous epoch, i.e. θ̄(m) = θin , where in is drawn uniformly
at random in {(m − 1)M, . . . , mM }. Thereafter, for the
epoch length M , CTD performs the following iteration: Set
θmM = θ̄(m) and for n = mM, . . . , (m + 1)M − 1 update

For finite state space settings, we obtain exponential convergence rate (10) since they are geometrically ergodic,
while for MDPs that do not mix exponentially fast, the second (mixing) term in (11) will dominate and decide the rate
of the CTD algorithm.

Bound in expectation Now we state a theorem bounding
the expected error for general step-size sequences:
Theorem 5. Under (A1)-(A6) and assuming that γn ≤
µ(1 − β)/(2(1 + β)2 ) for all n, we have,

We split the analysis in two, first considering the bound
in high probability, and second the bound in expectation.
Both bounds involve a martingale decomposition, the former of the centered error, and the latter of the iteration (1).
High probability bound We first state a theorem bounding the error with high probability for general step-sizes:
Theorem 4. Under (A1)-(A5) and (A6’), we have,

E(an | Fn ) − EΨ (an ) and ∆Mn := an − E(an | Fn )).
Then, we can rewrite TD(0) update as follows:
zn+1 = [I − γn (A + n + ∆Mn )] zn + γn 0n .
where 0n = fXn (θ∗ ) − EΨ (fXn (θ∗ )). n , 0n are the mixing error components that arise due to the fact that TD(0)
does not see samples from the stationary distribution of the
underlying Markov chain has not mixed, while the martingale difference ∆Mn arises out of a sampling error.

Concentration bounds for TD(0) with function approximation

The remaining proof amounts to bounding each of the
quantities on the RHS above. Bounding the error terms
(both mixing and martingale errors) is tricky because it requires the iterate θn to be bounded as well and we do not
project the iterates to artificially keep it bounded. Using
(A6) coupled with technical arguments we show that the
error terms stay bounded after unrolling the TD recursion.
The reader is referred to (Korda & Prashanth, 2014) for the
detailed proof.

Rates To bound the expected error we average the errors
of the non-averaged iterates. However, this averaging this
is not straightforward as the bound in Theorem 5 holds only
if n > n0 (which ensures that γn is sufficiently small).
Note that n0 can be easily derived from the specific form
of the step sequece. Hence we analyse the initial phase
(n < n0 ) and later phase n ≥ n0 separately as follows:

Rates For the expectation bound, the rate derivation involves bounding each term on the RHS in (12) after choosc0 c
. We sketch the derivation for the
ing step-sizes γn = (c+n)
second RHS term below:

The last term on RHS above is bounded using Theorem
1, while the first term is bounded by unrolling TD(0) recursion for the first n0 steps and bounding the individual terms
that arise using (A6).

The other terms can be bounded in a similar fashion and the
result in Theorem 1 follows.
For the bound in high probability, a calculation (see (Korda
& Prashanth, 2014)) shows that choosing the step-size as
before, we obtain

and the result in Theorem 1 follows after comparing the
summation above with an integral.
5.2. Iterate Averaging: Proof of Theorem 2
In order to prove the results in Theorem 2 we again consider the case of a general step sequence. Recall that
θ̄n+1 := (θ1 + . . . + θn )/n and let zn = θ̄n+1 − θ∗ . We
directly give a bound on the error in high probability for the
averaged iterates (the bound in expectation can be obtained
directly from the bound in Theorem 5):
Theorem 6. Suppose that ∀n > n0 , γn ≤ µ(1−β)/(2(1+
β)2 ). Then, under (A1)-(A5) and (A6’), and we have, ∀ ≥
0 and ∀n > n0 ,

For the rate of the bound in high probability, one has to
again separately bound the influence of the first n0 steps,
and then use the expectation bound together with 6. The
reader is referred to (Korda & Prashanth, 2014) for detailed
proofs.
5.3. TD(0) with centering: Proof of Theorem 3
Step 1: Let f¯Xin (θn ) := fXin (θn ) − fXin (θ̄(m) ) +
E(fXin (θ̄(m) ) | Fn ).. An one-step expansion of the recursion (9) gives

Fig. 2(a) presents the results obtained on this example. For
setting the step-sizes of TD(0), we used the guideline from
Theorem 1. Note that this results in convergence for TD(0),
with the caveat that setting the step-size constant c requires
knowledge of underlying transition structure through µ. It
is evident that TD(0) with averaging gives performance on
par with TD(0) and unlike TD(0), the setting of c is not constrained here. Given that convergence is rapid for TD(0) on
this example, we do not plot CTD in Fig 2(a) as the epoch
length suggested by Theorem 3 is 100 and this is already
enough for TD(0) itself to converge. CTD resulted in a
normalized value difference of about 0.03 on this example,
but the effect of averaging across epochs for CTD will be
seen better in the next example.
Example 2. Here the number of states are 100, the transitions are governed by a random stochastic matrix and the
rewards are random and bounded between 0 and 1. Features are 3-dimensional and are picked randomly in (0, 1).
The results obtained for the three algorithms are presented
in Fig. 2(b). It is evident that all algorithms converge, with
CTD showing the lowest variance. As in example 1, the
setting parameters for TD(0) was dictated by Theorem 1,
while for CTD, the step-size and epoch length were set such
that the constant C1 in Theorem 3 is less than 1.

and CTD algorithms. The normalised value difference is defined
to be kΦ(θn − θ∗ )kΨ /kΦ(θ∗ )kΨ .

where we have first simplified (13) before using the bound
on the variance of the centered term (from Step 2), and also
the fact that
(θ̄(m) − θ∗ )T I(θ̄(m) − θ∗ )
≤ µ−1 (θ̄(m) − θ∗ )T ΦT ΨΦ(θ̄(m) − θ∗ )
Step 4: Finally, we obtain (11) by unrolling (across
epochs) (14), and bounding the individual error terms involving (·) and en (·). For the latter, we use (A6”) and the
fact that we project the CTD iterates to a H-ball.

6. Numerical Experiments
We test the performance of TD(0), TD(0) with averaging
and CTD algorithms.
Example 1. This is a two-state toy example, which is borrowed from (Yu & Bertsekas, 2009). The setting has the
transition structure P = [0.2, 0.8; 0.3, 0.7] and the rewards
given by r(1, j) = 1, r(2, j) = 2, for j = 1, 2. The features are one-dimensional, i.e., Φ = (1 2)T .

7. Conclusions
TD(0) with linear function approximators is a well-known
policy evaluation algorithm. While asymptotic convergence rate results are available for this algorithm, there are
no finite-time bounds that quantify the rate of convergence.
In this paper, we derived non-asymptotic bounds, both in
high-probability as well as in expectation. From our results, we observed that iterate
averaging is necessary to ob√
tain the optimal O (1/ n) rate of convergence. This is
because, to obtain the optimal rate with the classic stepsize choice ∝ 1/n, it is necessary to know properties of
the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain.
We also proposed a fast variant of TD(0) that incorporates
a centering sequence and established that the rate of convergence of this algorithm is exponential. We established
the practicality of our bounds by using them to guide the
step-size choices in two synthetic experimental setups.
