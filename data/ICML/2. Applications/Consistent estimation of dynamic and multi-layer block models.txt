Abstract
Significant progress has been made recently on
theoretical analysis of estimators for the stochastic block model (SBM). In this paper, we consider the multi-graph SBM, which serves as a
foundation for many application settings including dynamic and multi-layer networks. We explore the asymptotic properties of two estimators for the multi-graph SBM, namely spectral
clustering and the maximum-likelihood estimate
(MLE), as the number of layers of the multigraph increases. We derive sufficient conditions
for consistency of both estimators and propose
a variational approximation to the MLE that is
computationally feasible for large networks. We
verify the sufficient conditions via simulation
and demonstrate that they are practical. In addition, we apply the model to two real data sets: a
dynamic social network and a multi-layer social
network with several types of relations.

1. Introduction
Modeling relational data arising from networks including social, biological, and information networks has received much attention recently. Various probabilistic models for networks have been proposed, including stochastic block models and their mixed-membership variants
(Airoldi et al., 2008; Goldenberg et al., 2010). However,
in many settings, we not only have a single network, but a
collection of networks over a common set of nodes, which
is often referred to as a multi-graph. Multi-graphs arise in
several types of settings including dynamic networks with

time-evolving edges, such as time-stamped social networks
of interactions between people, and multi-layer networks,
where edges are measured in multiple ways such as phone
calls, text messages, e-mails, face-to-face contacts, etc.
A significant challenge with multi-graphs is to extract common information across the layers of the multi-graph in a
concise representation, yet be flexible enough to allow differences across layers. Motivated by the above examples,
we consider the multi-graph stochastic block model first
proposed by Holland et al. (1983), which divides nodes into
classes that define blocks in the multi-graph. The key assumption is that nodes share the same block structure over
the multiple layers, but the class connection probabilities
may vary across layers. We believe this model is a flexible
and principled way of analyzing multi-graphs and provides
a strong foundation for many applications. The special case
of a single layer, often referred to simply as the stochastic
block model (SBM), has been studied extensively in recent
years (Bickel and Chen, 2009; Rohe et al., 2011; Choi et al.,
2012; Celisse et al., 2012; Jin, 2012; Bickel et al., 2013;
Amini et al., 2013). However, the more general multi-graph
case has not been studied as much.
In this paper, we explore the asymptotic properties of several estimators for the multi-graph SBM by letting the number of network layers grow while keeping the number of
nodes fixed. We prove that a spectral clustering estimate of
the class memberships is consistent for a special case of the
model (Section 4.1). Next we derive sufficient conditions
under which the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of
the class memberships is consistent in the general case
(Section 4.2). Finally we propose a variational approximation to the MLE that is computationally tractable and
is applicable to many multi-graph settings including dynamic and multi-layer networks (Section 4.2.1). We apply
the spectral and variational approximation methods to several simulated and real data sets, including both a dynamic
and a multi-relational social network (Section 5).

Consistent estimation of dynamic and multi-layer block models

Our main contribution is the consistency analysis for the
MLE, which ensures the tractability of the model and paves
the way for more sophisticated models and inference techniques. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first
theoretical results for the multi-graph SBM for a growing
number of layers.

2. Related work
Probabilistic models for networks have been studied for
several decades; many commonly used models are discussed in the survey by Goldenberg et al. (2010). More
recent work includes non-parametric network models using graphons (Airoldi et al., 2013; Wolfe and Olhede, 2013;
Gao et al., 2014). Most previous models assume that a single network, rather than a multi-graph, is observed.
Two settings where multi-graphs arise include dynamic and
multi-layer networks. Dynamic network models typically
assume that a sequence of network snapshots is observed
at discrete time steps. Previous work on dynamic network models has built upon models for a single network
augmented with Markovian dynamics. Ahmed and Xing
(2009); Hanneke et al. (2010) built upon exponential random graph models. Ishiguro et al. (2010); Yang et al.
(2011); Ho et al. (2011); Xu and Hero (2014); Xu (2015)
built on stochastic block models. Sarkar and Moore (2005);
Sarkar et al. (2007); Durante and Dunson (2014) used latent space models. Foulds et al. (2011); Heaukulani and
Ghahramani (2013); Kim and Leskovec (2013) used latent
feature models.
Multi-layer networks consider multiple types of connections simultaneously. For example, Facebook users interact by using “likes”, comments, messages, and other
means. Multi-layer networks go by many other names like
multi-relational, multi-dimensional, multi-view, and multiplex networks. The analysis of multi-layer networks has
a long history (Holland et al., 1983; Fienberg et al., 1985;
Szell et al., 2010; Mucha et al., 2010; Magnani and Rossi,
2011; Oselio et al., 2014). However there has not been
much work on probabilistic modeling of such networks,
aside from the multi-view latent space model proposed by
Salter-Townshend and McCormick (2013), which couples
the latent spaces of the multiple layers.
A third related setting involves modeling populations of
networks, where each observation consists of a network
snapshot drawn from a probability mass function over a
network-valued sample space. Durante et al. (2014) proposed a nonparametric Bayesian model for this setting.
This setting differs from the multi-graph setting that we
consider in this paper because the network snapshots (layers) are drawn in an independent and identically distributed
(iid) fashion, with no coupling between the snapshots.

The statistical properties of the inference algorithms in both
dynamic and multi-layer network models have not typically
been studied. Recently there has been a lot of progress
on consistency analysis for single networks. Maximumlikelihood estimation, its variational approximation, and
spectral clustering have all been proven to be consistent
under the stochastic block model (Bickel and Chen, 2009;
Rohe et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2012; Celisse et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2012; Jin, 2012; Bickel et al., 2013; Lei and
Rinaldo, 2014; Yang et al., 2014) as the number of nodes
N → ∞. Intuitively, for each new node added to the graph,
we observe N realizations, hence larger N provides more
information leading to consistent estimation of the model.
We extend the ideas used in single networks to multigraphs. We note that the asymptotic regime is different in
this case. For a single network, one typically lets N → ∞,
while for multi-graphs, we let T → ∞ with N fixed. Intuitively it means we do not need to observe a very large
network to get a correct understanding of the structure. Instead, we can gain the information through multiple samples, which may represent, for example, multiple observations over time or multiple relationships. In practice, it may
be more realistic to allow N to grow along with T , particularly for the dynamic network setting. Allowing N to grow
provides more information; thus our analysis with fixed N
serves as a conservative analysis for different settings.

3. Multi-graph stochastic block model
We present an overview of the multi-graph stochastic
block model first proposed by Holland et al. (1983). A
single relation is represented by an adjacency matrix
Gt = (Gtij ), i, j = 1, . . . , N . We focus on symmetric binary relations with no self-edges. For a multi-graph, we
~ = {G1 , G2 , . . . , GT } sharobserve an adjacency array G
ing the same set of nodes. Subscripts denote the same node
pairs for any t, while the superscript t indexes layers of
the multi-graph. A layer may refer to time or type of rela~ is a random adjation depending on the application. If G
cency array for N nodes and T relations, then the probabil~ is called a stochastic multi-graph. Let
ity distribution of G
t
the edge Gij be a Bernoulli random variable with success
probability Φtij . Φt = (Φtij ) ∈ [0, 1]N ×N is the probabil~ = {Φ1 , Φ2 . . . ΦT } be the
ity matrix of graph Gt . Let Φ
probability array. We assume the independence of edges
within and across layers conditioned on the probability array. That is, the adjacency array is generated according to
~ ind
Gtij |Φ
∼ Bern(Φtij ).
The multi-graph stochastic block model is a special case
of a stochastic multi-graph. In the multi-graph SBM,
networks are generated in the following manner. First

Consistent estimation of dynamic and multi-layer block models

each node is assigned to a class with probability π =
{π1 , . . . , πK } where πk is the probability for a node to
be assigned to class k. Then, given that nodes i and
j are in classes k and l, respectively, an edge between
i and j in network layer t is generated with probabilt
ity Pkl
. In other words, nodes in the same classes in
the same layer have the same connection probability governed by P~ = {P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P T } ∈ [0, 1]K×K , the class
connection probability array. Let ci ∈ {1, . . . , K} denote
the class label of node i. Then Φtij = Pcti cj .
The nodes have class labels ~c shared by all of the layers of the multi-graph, but in each layer the class cont
nection probabilities Pkl
may be different. As we consider undirected networks, P t is a symmetric matrix with
K(K + 1)/2 free parameters. One can see that the (single
network) SBM is a special case of the multi-graph SBM
with T = 1.
Though simple, this multi-graph model has not been formally studied in the a posteriori setting where class labels
are estimated. It serves as a basis for many settings including dynamic networks and networks with multiple relations. More importantly, it can be theoretically analyzed
and can provide insight on more complex models.

4. Consistent estimation for the multi-graph
stochastic block model
Holland et al. (1983) only discussed estimation of the
multi-graph SBM with blocks specified a priori. The sample proportion of each layer t is the maximum-likelihood
estimate (MLE) of the class probability matrix P t . However, in most applications, the block structure is unknown.
Hence our main goal is to accurately estimate the class
memberships. We extend several inference techniques used
for the single network SBM to the multi-layer case.
It is not immediately straightforward how we can utilize inference techniques designed for the single network SBM.
One may imagine inferring ~c independently from each network and averaging across them, e.g. by majority voting.
That is, each node is assigned the class label that occurs
most often. We find in simulations that this ad-hoc method
often does not work well.
We propose spectral clustering on the mean graph as a motivating method for a special case of the model. Then we
discuss maximum-likelihood estimation, a natural way to
combine the information contained in the different layers,
for the general case. Maximum-likelihood estimation is intractable for large networks so we also consider a variational approximation to the MLE.
Our main focus is on the consistency properties of these
methods. We consider a fixed number of nodes N but let

the number of graph layers T → ∞. In reality, although we
do not have infinite layers, we often encounter situations
with a large number of layers, such as dynamic networks
over long periods of time.
4.1. Consistency of spectral clustering
Spectral clustering is a popular choice for estimating the
block structure of the SBM because it scales to large networks and has shown to be consistent as N → ∞ (Sussman
et al., 2012). The method is based on singular value decomposition and K-means clustering on the singular vectors.
A natural way to extend spectral clustering from single networks to multi-graphsPis to apply spectral clustering on the
T
mean graph Ḡ = T1 t=1 Gt . This method is intuitively
appealing as it matches with the assumption of a single set
of class labels shared by all of the layers. We show that under some stationarity and ergodicity conditions, it indeed
provides a consistent estimate of the class assignments.
Specifically we consider the case where the class connection probabilities P t vary across layers but have the same
mean M . The following theorem shows the consistency of
spectral clustering on the mean graph Ḡ if the mean M is
identifiable.
Theorem 1. Assume P~ follows a stationary ergodic prot
t
cess such that E(Pkl
) = µkl and V ar(Pkl
) = 2kl for all
t. Assume M = [µkl ] is identifiable, i.e. M has no idenPT
tical rows. Let Ḡ = T1 t=1 Gt . Spectral clustering of
Ḡ gives accurate labels as T → ∞. That is, let UN ×K
be the first K right singular vectors in the singular value
decomposition of Ḡ. K-means clustering on the rows of
UN ×K outputs class estimates ĉ1 , ..., ĉN . Up to permutation, ĉ = c, a.s. as T → ∞.
We provide a sketch of the proof; details can be found in a
longer version posted on arXiv (Han et al., 2015). Since we
have independent errors in the probability matrix and also
independent errors in the Bernoulli observations, averaging
cancels the error so that Ḡ → CM C 0 . Here C is a rank K
matrix incorporating the class assignment vectors. Using
an inequality from Oliveira (2009), we bound the distance
between the singular vectors of Ḡ and CM C 0 . Therefore,
spectral clustering on Ḡ clusters the nodes into K different
classes.
Remark 1. To determine the number of classes is a difficult
model selection problem even for a single network. We
will not discuss this problem in detail. We assume K is
fixed and known in this paper.
Remark 2. The diagonal of Gt is always 0 because no selfedges are allowed; however the diagonal of CM C 0 is not
necessarily 0. This may not cause a problem as N → ∞.
But for finite N , it may cause error in estimating the singular vectors. If this is the case, we may utilize the singular
value decomposition that minimizes the off-diagonal mean

z. To ease notation, let
σ(p) = p log(p) + (1 − p) log(1 − p).

which can be computed by iterative singular value decomposition (Scheinerman and Tucker, 2010).
The condition in Theorem 1 requiring P~ to be stationary
with identifiable mean M is restrictive. Spectral clustering
on the mean graph is not effective in many cases. Consider
the case for which

where both outcomes are equally likely for all t. Then

is not identifiable. Spectral clustering on the mean graph
fails to correctly estimate the class assignments as T →
∞. But there is information contained in this multi-graph.
We can use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the
class assignments correctly in this case.

Denote the expectation of log-likelihood of (z, P̄ (z)) as
X
h(z) = E[l(z, P̄ (z))] =
nkl (z) σ(P̄ (z)).
k≤l

Now, as we do not observe the true P , the natural step is to
estimate it with the empirical mean for any given z. So let

Now we focus on the general case where we do not place
any structure on P~ . A natural way to estimate the class
assignment is to use the maximum-likelihood estimate
(MLE). We show that for a large enough fixed N , the MLE
will estimate the class memberships correctly as T → ∞.
First we define some notation. For any class assignment z,
let nk (z) = #{i : zi = k} be the number of nodes in class
k. Let m(z) = mink nk (z) denote the minimum number
of nodes in any class under labels z. Let
(
nk nl ,
k 6= l
nkl (z) =
nk (nk − 1)/2, k = l.
be the number of pairs of nodes in each block. We drop
the dependency on z whenever it is unambiguous. We also
drop the superscript t when we talk about a single layer of
the network.
Now define some notation related to the MLE. The complete log-likelihood for parameters (z, P ) is

l(z, P ) =
Gij log(Pzi zj ) + (1 − Gij ) log(1 − Pzi zj ) .

Here P is a parameter not to be confused with the true class
connection probability matrix. In particular, we are interested in the case Pkl = P̄kl (z) where

Now we are ready to state the consistency of the MLE for
the multi-graph SBM. If all elements of P t are bounded
away from 0 and 1 and their column differences are at least
some distance apart, then when we have a sufficient number
of nodes in each block, the true label c uniquely maximizes
the sum of profile log-likelihoods over the layers.

The idea is that t f t (z) is the sum of independent profile
log-likelihoods. We need N to be sufficiently large so that
the expectation of the profile log-likelihood at each layer is
maximized at the true labels c.P
Then as T → ∞, we have
convergence to expectation for t f t (z). We formalize the
ideas by establishing the following lemmas.
Lemma 1 (From Choi et al. (2012)). For any label assignment z, let r(z) count the number of nodes whose true class

of f and l. This is newly studied here. In other words, for
some particular class connection probability matrix P , the
number of nodes required in a single network to have an
accurate estimate is much larger than what is needed in a
multi-graph with a growing number of layers.

Then the expectation of the log-likelihood h is maximized
by h(c), and

Lemma 1 shows the expectation of the log-likelihood is
maximized at the true parameters, and the difference of the
true parameters and any other candidate is at least some
distance apart which depends on the column difference of
the probability matrix. However, as we work with the profile log-likelihood, we establish Lemmas 2 and 3 to bound
the difference between the expectation of the profile loglikelihood and the complete log-likelihood.

The MLE is computationally infeasible for large networks
because the number of candidate class assignments grows
exponentially with the number of nodes. To overcome the
computational burden, variational approximation, which
replaces the joint distribution with independent marginal
distributions, can be used to approximate the MLE. Daudin
et al. (2008) has a detailed discussion of variational approximation in the SBM. We adapt it to the multi-graph SBM,
resulting in the following update equations:

where the bik ’s denote the variational parameters. The
derivation is straightforward; we provide details in the
longer version posted on arXiv (Han et al., 2015).

Lemma 3. Assume C0 ≤ Pkl ≤ 1 − C0 , C0 > 0. For
any δ0 > 0 and any z, if mink nk (z) is large enough, then
the difference between the expectation of the profile loglikelihood g(z) and the expectation of the complete loglikelihood h(z) is bounded in the following manner:




g(z) − h(z) − K(K + 1)  ≤ δ0 .

Variational approximation has been shown to be consistent
in the SBM (Celisse et al., 2012; Bickel et al., 2013). We
conjecture that the performance of variational approximation is also good in the multi-graph SBM. Unless otherwise
specified we use variational approximation to replace the
MLE in all experiments.

Lemma 2 utilizes a Taylor series expansion. For simplicity,
we use big O(·) notation instead of specifying an actual
bound. Readers can refer to the longer version posted on
arXiv for the bound and the constants in the bound (Han
et al., 2015). Lemma 3 uses Lemma 2 and shows that with
a sufficiently large number of nodes, the difference of the
expectation of the profile log-likelihood and complete loglikelihood is K(K + 1)/4 and a negligible term δ0 . Combining the lemmas and using the concentration inequality,
we can show that Theorem 2 provides sufficient conditions
for the consistency of the multi-graph SBM. The proofs of
Lemmas 1–3 and Theorem 2 can be found also in the longer
version posted on arXiv (Han et al., 2015).
Remark 3. The main difference between the N → ∞ case
considered in most previous work and the T → ∞ case that
we consider is that, for N → ∞, a direct bound is put on f
and l. For T → ∞, we need only to bound the expectation

5. Experiments
We begin with a toy example where we investigate empirically how many nodes are needed for the profile MLE to
correctly recover the classes as T → ∞. Due to the computational intractability of computing the exact profile MLE,
we consider very a small network with N = 16 nodes and
K = 2 classes where each class has 8 nodes. Consider two
multi-graph SBMs with the following probability matrices:

0.45 0.55


0.51 0.49
Case 2: P t ≡
0.49 0.51
The δ (defined in Theorem 2) corresponding to the row
difference of P t is much smaller in case 2. Empirically

As previously mentioned, majority voting is another way
to utilize inference methods for a single network on multigraphs. We consider two majority vote methods as baselines for comparison, one that utilizes spectral clustering
on each layer, and one that applies a variational approximation to each layer. When using majority voting between
different layers of the network, the estimated class labels
for each layer must first be aligned or matched. We utilize
the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) to compute the maximum agreement matching between the estimated labels at
layer t with the majority vote up to layer t − 1.

the profile MLE succeeds to get the true labels in case 1
while it fails in case 2. Further analysis shows that in order
to have consistency given the class connection probability
matrix P t in case 2, the total number of nodes should be at
least 40. This toy example demonstrates that conditions on
the probability matrices and network size are necessary for
consistency. Theorem 2 provides sufficient conditions.
Next we investigate the tightness of the conditions in Theorem 2. The tightness of Lemma 1 was studied by Choi
et al. (2012). We check the tightness of Lemma 2. For different p, we can calculate the exact value of N (E(σ(x)) −
σ(p)) − 1/2 and compare it to the bound from Lemma 2.
Figure 1 shows that the bound is loose for small N , but has
almost the same asymptotic decay as the exact calculation.
For small N , the remainder in Taylor expansion causes deviation. Also the bounds are looser for p closer to 0 or 1
but still informative in most cases.
For the special case of K = 2 classes, we can calculate
all of the constants in the sufficient conditions in Theorem
2 for different values of C0 and δ by enumerating cases.
Details are provided in the longer version posted on arXiv
(Han et al., 2015). Table 1 shows the smallest number
of nodes N that is sufficient for consistency of the profile

We conduct simulations to compare our proposed methods of spectral clustering on the mean graph and profile maximum-likelihood estimation with the majority vote
baselines. We consider a well-studied scenario where we
have 128 nodes initialized randomly into 4 classes (Newman and Girvan, 2004). For each layer, the within-class
connection probability is 0.0968, and the between-class
connection probability is 0.0521. Under such connection
probabilities, the classes are below the detectability limit
(Decelle et al., 2011) for a single layer, so the class estimation accuracy from a single layer is very low. We increase the number of layers and observe how the accuracy
changes.
Figure 2 shows the accuracy of the two proposed methods compared to the two majority voting methods averaged
over 100 replications. Both the profile MLE and spectral clustering on the mean graph have the anticipated in-

creasing accuracy over time. But the accuracies of the two
heuristic majority vote methods do not improve. Though
one may expect the errors in majority vote to be canceled
out over time, these results show that, without careful averaging of errors, we cannot gain from the multiple layers.
We find that this is due to choosing connection probabilities below the detectability limit; if we make the estimation
problem easier by increasing the within-class probability
above the detectability limit, then the majority vote methods do improve with increasing layers, albeit much slower
than the methods we propose in this paper.
5.3. MIT Reality Mining data
Next we apply our model on the MIT Reality Mining data
set (Eagle and Pentland, 2006). This data set comprises
93 students and staff at MIT in the 2004-2005 school year
during which time their cell phone activities were recorded.
We construct dynamic networks based on physical proximity, which was measured using scans for nearby Bluetooth
devices at 5-minute intervals. We exclude data near the beginning and end of the experiment where participation was
low. We discretize time into 1-week intervals, similar to
Mutlu and Aviyente (2012); Xu et al. (2014), resulting in
39 time steps between August 2004 and May 2005.
We treat the affiliation of participants as ground-truth class
labels and test our proposed methods. Two communities
are found: one of 26 Sloan business school students, and
one of 67 staff working in the same building. Since degree
heterogeneity may cause problems in detecting communities using the SBM (Karrer and Newman, 2011), we reduce
its impact by connecting each participant to the 5 other participants who spent the most time in physical proximity
during each week. Figure 3 shows the empirical block connection probabilities within and between the two classes,

estimated by the profile MLE. The class connection probabilities vary significantly over time, which validates the
importance of the varying class connection probability assumption in our model. Notice that the two communities
become well-separated around week 8. The class estimation accuracies for the different methods are shown in Table 2. Since the community structure only becomes clear at
around week 8, the spectral and profile MLE methods are
initially worse than majority voting but quickly improve
and are superior over the remainder of the data trace. By
combining information across time, the proposed methods
successfully reveal the community structure while majority voting continues to improperly estimate the classes of
about 20% of the people.
5.4. AU-CS multi-layer network data
We look at another example from a multi-layer network
comprising five kinds of self-reported on-line and off-line
relationships between the employees of a research department: Facebook, leisure, work, co-authorship, and lunch
(AU-CS ML, 2014). We assume the class structure to be invariant across the different types of relations and apply our

model. For model selection, we extend the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion proposed by Daudin
et al. (2008) for the single network SBM to multi-graphs to
select the number of blocks K. Specifically we maximize

~ is the variational approximation to the comwhere Q(G)
plete log-likelihood. We initialize the variational approximation with different randomizations as well as the spectral
clustering solution. The term is maximized at K = 4.
Figure 4 shows the estimated 4 classes overlaid onto the
adjacency matrix of each relation. Although we have no
ground truth for this data set, we detect well-separated
communities in all relations aside from co-authorship,
which is an extremely sparse layer. Notice once again the
difference in empirical connection probabilities over the
multiple layers of the multi-graph.
For this data set, we do not have ground truth labels to
evaluate the class estimation accuracy. We note, however,
that the ICL obtained by our variational approximation algorithm is much better than the ICLs obtained by fitting
an SBM on the mean graph and by majority vote, both of
which are over 4000.

6. Discussion
In this paper, we investigated the multi-graph stochastic
block model applied to dynamic and multi-layer networks
with invariant class structure. Both spectral clustering on
the mean graph and maximum-likelihood estimation are
proved to be consistent for a fixed number of nodes when
we have an increasing number of network layers, provided
certain sufficient conditions are satisfied.
There are several interesting avenues for extensions of our
analysis. First we can add a layer of probabilistic modeling
on the probability matrices if we have additional information. Since dynamic networks usually vary smoothly over
time, we can put a state-space model on the adjacency array
(Xu and Hero, 2014). We can also use a hierarchical model
on the probability matrices to couple them for analyzing
multi-layer networks. Since our sufficient conditions do not
consider such additional structure, an interesting area of future work would be to derive sufficient conditions that utilize the structure on the probability matrices, which would
likely produce tighter bounds. It would also be interesting
to draw connections to recent work on consistent estimation for populations of networks (Durante et al., 2014), for
which no coupling between samples (layers) exists.
