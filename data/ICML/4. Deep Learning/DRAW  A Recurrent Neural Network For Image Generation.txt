Abstract
This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) neural network architecture
for image generation. DRAW networks combine
a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics
the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential
variational auto-encoding framework that allows
for the iterative construction of complex images.
The system substantially improves on the state
of the art for generative models on MNIST, and,
when trained on the Street View House Numbers
dataset, it generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye.

1. Introduction
A person asked to draw, paint or otherwise recreate a visual
scene will naturally do so in a sequential, iterative fashion,
reassessing their handiwork after each modification. Rough
outlines are gradually replaced by precise forms, lines are
sharpened, darkened or erased, shapes are altered, and the
final picture emerges. Most approaches to automatic image generation, however, aim to generate entire scenes at
once. In the context of generative neural networks, this typically means that all the pixels are conditioned on a single
latent distribution (Dayan et al., 1995; Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; Larochelle & Murray, 2011). As well as precluding the possibility of iterative self-correction, the “one
shot” approach is fundamentally difficult to scale to large
images. The Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) architecture represents a shift towards a more natural form of
image construction, in which parts of a scene are created
independently from others, and approximate sketches are
successively refined.

Figure 1. A trained DRAW network generating MNIST digits. Each row shows successive stages in the generation of a single digit. Note how the lines composing the digits appear to be
“drawn” by the network. The red rectangle delimits the area attended to by the network at each time-step, with the focal precision indicated by the width of the rectangle border.

The core of the DRAW architecture is a pair of recurrent
neural networks: an encoder network that compresses the
real images presented during training, and a decoder that
reconstitutes images after receiving codes. The combined
system is trained end-to-end with stochastic gradient descent, where the loss function is a variational upper bound
on the log-likelihood of the data. It therefore belongs to the
family of variational auto-encoders, a recently emerged
hybrid of deep learning and variational inference that has
led to significant advances in generative modelling (Gregor et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al.,
2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Salimans et al., 2014). Where
DRAW differs from its siblings is that, rather than generat-

DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation

ing images in a single pass, it iteratively constructs scenes
through an accumulation of modifications emitted by the
decoder, each of which is observed by the encoder.
An obvious correlate of generating images step by step is
the ability to selectively attend to parts of the scene while
ignoring others. A wealth of results in the past few years
suggest that visual structure can be better captured by a sequence of partial glimpses, or foveations, than by a single sweep through the entire image (Larochelle & Hinton,
2010; Denil et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2013; Ranzato, 2014;
Zheng et al., 2014; Mnih et al., 2014; Ba et al., 2014; Sermanet et al., 2014). The main challenge faced by sequential
attention models is learning where to look, which can be
addressed with reinforcement learning techniques such as
policy gradients (Mnih et al., 2014). The attention model in
DRAW, however, is fully differentiable, making it possible
to train with standard backpropagation. In this sense it resembles the selective read and write operations developed
for the Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014).
The following section defines the DRAW architecture,
along with the loss function used for training and the procedure for image generation. Section 3 presents the selective attention model and shows how it is applied to reading and modifying images. Section 4 provides experimental results on the MNIST, Street View House Numbers and CIFAR-10 datasets, with examples of generated
images; and concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
Lastly, we would like to direct the reader to the video
accompanying this paper (https://www.youtube.

Figure 2. Left: Conventional Variational Auto-Encoder. During generation, a sample z is drawn from a prior P (z) and passed
through the feedforward decoder network to compute the probability of the input P (x|z) given the sample. During inference the
input x is passed to the encoder network, producing an approximate posterior Q(z|x) over latent variables. During training, z
is sampled from Q(z|x) and then used
 to compute the total description length KL Q(Z|x)||P (Z) − log(P (x|z)), which is
minimised with stochastic gradient descent. Right: DRAW Network. At each time-step a sample zt from the prior P (zt ) is
passed to the recurrent decoder network, which then modifies part
of the canvas matrix. The final canvas matrix cT is used to compute P (x|z1:T ). During inference the input is read at every timestep and the result is passed to the encoder RNN. The RNNs at
the previous time-step specify where to read. The output of the
encoder RNN is used to compute the approximate posterior over
the latent variables at that time-step.

as “what to write”. The architecture is sketched in Fig. 2,
alongside a feedforward variational auto-encoder.
2.1. Network Architecture

2. The DRAW Network
The basic structure of a DRAW network is similar to that of
other variational auto-encoders: an encoder network determines a distribution over latent codes that capture salient
information about the input data; a decoder network receives samples from the code distribuion and uses them to
condition its own distribution over images. However there
are three key differences. Firstly, both the encoder and decoder are recurrent networks in DRAW, so that a sequence
of code samples is exchanged between them; moreover the
encoder is privy to the decoder’s previous outputs, allowing it to tailor the codes it sends according to the decoder’s
behaviour so far. Secondly, the decoder’s outputs are successively added to the distribution that will ultimately generate the data, as opposed to emitting this distribution in
a single step. And thirdly, a dynamically updated attention mechanism is used to restrict both the input region
observed by the encoder, and the output region modified
by the decoder. In simple terms, the network decides at
each time-step “where to read” and “where to write” as well

Let RNN enc be the function enacted by the encoder network at a single time-step. The output of RNN enc at time
t is the encoder hidden vector henc
t . Similarly the output of
the decoder RNN dec at t is the hidden vector hdec
t . In general the encoder and decoder may be implemented by any
recurrent neural network. In our experiments we use the
Long Short-Term Memory architecture (LSTM; Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber (1997)) for both, in the extended form with
forget gates (Gers et al., 2000). We favour LSTM due
to its proven track record for handling long-range dependencies in real sequential data (Graves, 2013; Sutskever
et al., 2014). Throughout the paper, we use the notation
b = W (a) to denote a linear weight matrix with bias from
the vector a to the vector b.
At each time-step t, the encoder receives input from both
the image x and from the previous decoder hidden vector
hdec
t−1 . The precise form of the encoder input depends on a
read operation, which will be defined in the next section.
The output henc
of the encoder is used to parameterise a
t
distribution Q(Zt |henc
t ) over the latent vector zt . In our

experiments the latent distribution is a diagonal Gaussian

Bernoulli distributions are more common than Gaussians
for latent variables in auto-encoders (Dayan et al., 1995;
Gregor et al., 2014); however a great advantage of Gaussian latents is that the gradient of a function of the samples with respect to the distribution parameters can be easily obtained using the so-called reparameterization trick
(Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014). This
makes it straightforward to back-propagate unbiased, low
variance stochastic gradients of the loss function through
the latent distribution.
At each time-step a sample zt ∼ Q(Zt |henc
t ) drawn from
the latent distribution is passed as input to the decoder. The
of the decoder is added (via a write operaoutput hdec
t
tion, defined in the sequel) to a cumulative canvas matrix
ct , which is ultimately used to reconstruct the image. The
total number of time-steps T consumed by the network before performing the reconstruction is a free parameter that
must be specified in advance.

For each image x presented to the network, c0 , henc

The latent loss L for a sequence of latent distributions

(10)

Note that this loss depends upon the latent samples zt
drawn from Q(Zt |henc
t ), which depend in turn on the input
x. If the latent distribution is a diagonal Gaussian with µt ,
σt as defined in Eqs 1 and 2, a simple choice for P (Zt ) is
a standard Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation
one, in which case Eq. 10 becomes
!

(11)
Lz =

The total loss L for the network is the expectation of the
sum of the reconstruction and latent losses:
L = hLx + Lz iz∼Q

(12)

which we optimise using a single sample of z for each
stochastic gradient descent step.
Lz can be interpreted as the number of nats required to
transmit the latent sample sequence z1:T to the decoder
from the prior, and (if x is discrete) Lx is the number of
nats required for the decoder to reconstruct x given z1:T .
The total loss is therefore equivalent to the expected compression of the data by the decoder and prior.

2.3. Stochastic Data Generation

An image x̃ can be generated by a DRAW network by iteratively picking latent samples z̃t from the prior P , then
running the decoder to update the canvas matrix c̃t . After T
repetitions of this process the generated image is a sample
from D(X|c̃T ):

where x̂t is the error image, [v, w] is the concatenation
of vectors v and w into a single vector, and σ denotes
1

will sometimes make this dependency explicit by writing
Q(Zt |x, z1:t−1 ), as shown in Fig. 2. henc can also be
passed as input to the read operation; however we did not
find that this helped performance and therefore omitted it.

3. Read and Write Operations

The final canvas matrix cT is used to parameterise a model
D(X|cT ) of the input data. If the input is binary, the natural
choice for D is a Bernoulli distribution with means given
by σ(cT ). The reconstruction loss Lx is defined as the

The DRAW network described in the previous section is
not complete until the read and write operations in Eqs. 4
and 8 have been defined. This section describes two ways
to do so, one with selective attention and one without.

(17)
(18)

However this approach does not allow the encoder to focus on only part of the input when creating the latent distribution; nor does it allow the decoder to modify only a
part of the canvas vector. In other words it does not provide the network with an explicit selective attention mechanism, which we believe to be crucial to large scale image
generation. We refer to the above configuration as “DRAW
without attention”.
3.2. Selective Attention Model
To endow the network with selective attention without sacrificing the benefits of gradient descent training, we take inspiration from the differentiable attention mechanisms recently used in handwriting synthesis (Graves, 2013) and
Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014). Unlike
the aforementioned works, we consider an explicitly twodimensional form of attention, where an array of 2D Gaussian filters is applied to the image, yielding an image
‘patch’ of smoothly varying location and zoom. This configuration, which we refer to simply as “DRAW”, somewhat resembles the affine transformations used in computer
graphics-based autoencoders (Tieleman, 2014).
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the N ×N grid of Gaussian filters is
positioned on the image by specifying the co-ordinates of
the grid centre and the stride distance between adjacent filters. The stride controls the ‘zoom’ of the patch; that is, the
larger the stride, the larger an area of the original image will
be visible in the attention patch, but the lower the effective
resolution of the patch will be. The grid centre (gX , gY )
and stride δ (both of which are real-valued) determine the
mean location µiX , µjY of the filter at row i, column j in the
patch as follows:
µiX = gX + (i − N/2 − 0.5) δ
µjY

= gY + (j − N/2 − 0.5) δ

(19)
(20)

Two more parameters are required to fully specify the attention model: the isotropic variance σ 2 of the Gaussian
filters, and a scalar intensity γ that multiplies the filter response. Given an A × B input image x, all five attention
parameters are dynamically determined at each time step

gY {
gX

{

read (x, x̂t , hdec
t−1 ) = [x, x̂t ]

{

In the simplest instantiation of DRAW the entire input image is passed to the encoder at every time-step, and the decoder modifies the entire canvas matrix at every time-step.
In this case the read and write operations reduce to

Figure 3. Left: A 3 × 3 grid of filters superimposed on an image.
The stride (δ) and centre location (gX , gY ) are indicated. Right:
Three N × N patches extracted from the image (N = 12). The
green rectangles on the left indicate the boundary and precision
(σ) of the patches, while the patches themselves are shown to the
right. The top patch has a small δ and high σ, giving a zoomed-in
but blurry view of the centre of the digit; the middle patch has
large δ and low σ, effectively downsampling the whole image;
and the bottom patch has high δ and σ.

where the variance, stride and intensity are emitted in the
log-scale to ensure positivity. The scaling of gX , gY and δ
is chosen to ensure that the initial patch (with a randomly
initialised network) roughly covers the whole input image.
Given the attention parameters emitted by the decoder, the
horizontal and vertical filterbank matrices FX and FY (dimensions N × A and N × B respectively) are defined as
follows:

that ensure that a FX [i, a] = 1 and b FY [j, b] = 1.

DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation

generated by the network are always novel (not simply
copies of training examples), and are virtually indistinguishable from real data for MNIST and SVHN; the generated CIFAR images are somewhat blurry, but still contain
recognisable structure from natural scenes. The binarized
MNIST results substantially improve on the state of the art.
As a preliminary exercise, we also evaluate the 2D attention module of the DRAW network on cluttered MNIST
classification.

Middle: A 12 × 12 patch extracted with 144 2D Gaussian filters.
Top Right: The reconstructed image when applying transposed
filters on the patch. Bottom: Only two 2D Gaussian filters are
displayed. The first one is used to produce the top-left patch feature. The last filter is used to produce the bottom-right patch feature. By using different filter weights, the attention can be moved
to a different location.

3.3. Reading and Writing With Attention
Given FX , FY and intensity γ determined by hdec
t−1 , along
with an input image x and error image x̂t , the read operation returns the concatenation of two N × N patches from
the image and error image:
T
T
read (x, x̂t , hdec
t−1 ) = γ[FY xFX , FY x̂FX ]

Network hyper-parameters for all the experiments are
presented in Table 3. The Adam optimisation algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) was used throughout. Examples of generation sequences for MNIST and SVHN
are provided in the accompanying video (https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=Zt-7MI9eKEo).
4.1. Cluttered MNIST Classification

(27)

Note that the same filterbanks are used for both the image
and error image. For the write operation, a distinct set of
attention parameters γ̂, F̂X and F̂Y are extracted from hdec
t ,
the order of transposition is reversed, and the intensity is
inverted:
wt = W (hdec
t )
1
write(hdec
F̂ T wt F̂X
t )=
γ̂ Y

For all experiments, the model D(X|cT ) of the input data
was a Bernoulli distribution with means given by σ(cT ).
For the MNIST experiments, the reconstruction loss from
Eq 9 was the usual binary cross-entropy term. For the
SVHN and CIFAR-10 experiments, the red, green and blue
pixel intensities were represented as numbers between 0
and 1, which were then interpreted as independent colour
emission probabilities. The reconstruction loss was therefore the cross-entropy between the pixel intensities and the
model probabilities. Although this approach worked well
in practice, it means that the training loss did not correspond to the true compression cost of RGB images.

(28)
(29)

where wt is the N × N writing patch emitted by hdec
t . For
colour images each point in the input and error image (and
hence in the reading and writing patches) is an RGB triple.
In this case the same reading and writing filters are used for
all three channels.

4. Experimental Results
We assess the ability of DRAW to generate realisticlooking images by training on three datasets of progressively increasing visual complexity: MNIST (LeCun et al.,
1998), Street View House Numbers (SVHN) (Netzer et al.,
2011) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009). The images

To test the classification efficacy of the DRAW attention
mechanism (as opposed to its ability to aid in image generation), we evaluate its performance on the 100 × 100 cluttered translated MNIST task (Mnih et al., 2014). Each image in cluttered MNIST contains many digit-like fragments
of visual clutter that the network must distinguish from the
true digit to be classified. As illustrated in Fig. 5, having
an iterative attention model allows the network to progressively zoom in on the relevant region of the image, and
ignore the clutter outside it.
Our model consists of an LSTM recurrent network that receives a 12 × 12 ‘glimpse’ from the input image at each
time-step, using the selective read operation defined in Section 3.2. After a fixed number of glimpses the network uses
a softmax layer to classify the MNIST digit. The network
is similar to the recently introduced Recurrent Attention
Model (RAM) (Mnih et al., 2014), except that our attention
method is differentiable; we therefore refer to it as “Differentiable RAM”.
The results in Table 1 demonstrate a significant improvement in test error over the original RAM network. Moreover our model had only a single attention patch at each

4.2. MNIST Generation
We trained the full DRAW network as a generative model
on the binarized MNIST dataset (Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008). This dataset has been widely studied in the
literature, allowing us to compare the numerical performance (measured in average nats per image on the test
set) of DRAW with existing methods. Table 2 shows that
DRAW without selective attention performs comparably to
other recent generative models such as DARN, NADE and
DBMs, and that DRAW with attention considerably improves on the state of the art.

Figure 6. Generated MNIST images. All digits were generated
by DRAW except those in the rightmost column, which shows the
training set images closest to those in the column second to the
right (pixelwise L2 is the distance measure). Note that the network was trained on binary samples, while the generated images
are mean probabilities.

Once the DRAW network was trained, we generated
MNIST digits following the method in Section 2.3, examples of which are presented in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 illustrates
the image generation sequence for a DRAW network without selective attention (see Section 3.1). It is interesting to
compare this with the generation sequence for DRAW with
attention, as depicted in Fig. 1. Whereas without attention
it progressively sharpens a blurred image in a global way,

with attention it constructs the digit by tracing the lines—
much like a person with a pen.
4.3. MNIST Generation with Two Digits
The main motivation for using an attention-based generative model is that large images can be built up iteratively,
by adding to a small part of the image at a time. To test
this capability in a controlled fashion, we trained DRAW
to generate images with two 28 × 28 MNIST images chosen at random and placed at random locations in a 60 × 60
black background. In cases where the two digits overlap,
the pixel intensities were added together at each point and
clipped to be no greater than one. Examples of generated
data are shown in Fig. 8. The network typically generates
one digit and then the other, suggesting an ability to recreate composite scenes from simple pieces.
4.4. Street View House Number Generation
MNIST digits are very simplistic in terms of visual structure, and we were keen to see how well DRAW performed
on natural images. Our first natural image generation experiment used the multi-digit Street View House Numbers
dataset (Netzer et al., 2011). We used the same preprocessing as (Goodfellow et al., 2013), yielding a 64 × 64 house
number image for each training example. The network was
then trained using 54 × 54 patches extracted at random locations from the preprocessed images. The SVHN training
set contains 231,053 images, and the validation set contains
4,701 images.
The house number images generated by the network are

shows the training images closest (in L2 distance) to the generated images beside them. Note that the two columns are visually
similar, but the numbers are generally different.

highly realistic, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Fig. 11 reveals
that, despite the long training time, the DRAW network underfit the SVHN training data.
4.5. Generating CIFAR Images
The most challenging dataset we applied DRAW to was
the CIFAR-10 collection of natural images (Krizhevsky,

This paper introduced the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer
(DRAW) neural network architecture, and demonstrated its
ability to generate highly realistic natural images such as
photographs of house numbers, as well as improving on the
best known results for binarized MNIST generation. We
also established that the two-dimensional differentiable attention mechanism embedded in DRAW is beneficial not
only to image generation, but also to image classification.
